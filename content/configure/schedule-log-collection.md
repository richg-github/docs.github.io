# Log Management Collection Schedules

When you create a Log ManagementÂ policy for the first time, you can create collection schedules. Collection schedules allow you to black out periods when you do not need to collect log sources. You can create new collection schedules for a policy at any time. However, you cannot delete or update existing schedules.

For more information about policy creation, see [Log Management Policies](log-management-policies.md).
