# Web Security ManagerÂ AWS V5 Auto Scaling Upgrade with CloudFormation Template

Web Security Manager must upgrade auto scaling to version 5 in the AWS console. Alert Logic no longer supports CentOS version 6. This requires you to upgrade your Web Security Manager auto scaling for AWS to the latest operating version. This document provides instructions for customers who want to create a new CloudFormation template. For instructions on how to upgrade with an existing CloudFormation template, see [Web Security Manager AWS V5  Auto Scaling Upgrade  with an Existing Stack](WSM5-aws-autoscaling-upgrade.md).

You must first request the latest version of the Alert Logic Managed Web Application Firewall (WAF) Amazon Machine Image (AMI) and the CloudFormation template from [WSM Alert Logic support](mailto:support@alertlogic.com). In the email, make sure you include your AWS Account ID.

After you have the latest AMI, you must ensure your AMI is set to the region you are using and predetermine your VPCs and subnets.
