# Manage Notifications

The Notifications page, listed under ![](../../Resources/Images/dashboard/manage-icon.png)**Manage** in the Alert Logic console, offers a consolidated view of your notifications. The list includes all notifications created in your account. You can create, view, and manage notifications of all types from this page.

The main panel on the right  summarizes your notifications and organizes them in these tabs:

* **Alert Notifications**        —Lists alert-based notifications such as incidents and log correlation observations. You can create  a notification, and you can filter and search the list.
* **Schedules**        —Lists notifications for scheduled activities, such as scheduled reports. You can create a schedule, and you can filter and search the list.

To access the Notifications page, click the Settings icon (![](../../Resources/Images/supportThreeDots.png)), and then click **Notifications**.

## Create any type of notification

One way to create a notification of any type is directly from the Notifications page. You can create notifications from other pages according to notification type:

* For incidents, you can also create a notification from the Incidents page. For more information, see [Incident Notifications](incident.md).
* For observations, you can also create a notification   from the Search page (Log Search tab or Correlations tab) during the process of creating the correlation or by editing an existing correlation listed on the Correlations tab. For more information, see [Correlations and Notifications](log-correlation.md) and [Observation Notifications](observation.md).
* For health exposures, you can also create a notification from the Health page. For more information, see [Health](../../analyze/health.md).
* For scheduled reports, you can also schedule the report and subscribe notification recipients from the Reports page. For more information, see [Scheduled Reports and Notifications](report.md).
* For scheduled File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) searches, you can schedule a search and subscribe notification recipients from the Notifications page. For more information, see [File Integrity Monitoring Search Notification](fim-search.md).

For more information about setting up the notification, see [Start creating a correlation](log-correlation.md#Create).The **Observation** option redirects you from the Notifications page to the Correlations tab on the Search page.

* **Schedule Report**        — Select this type to schedule a report to run periodically. When the report is generated, Alert Logic sends a notification to subscribed recipients. For more information about setting up the scheduled report notification, see [Create a report schedule and notification](report.md#Create).					
The **Schedule Report** option redirects you from the Notifications page to the Reports page to set up the report you want to schedule.

* Managed (child) accounts, if the notification was created in the parent account

In a managed account, the notifications list:

* Includes only notifications created in that account
* Does not include notifications created in a managing account
* Does not include notifications created in another managed account

## Manage notifications and subscriptions of others

You can manage the notification settings of others—including subscribing other users or a connector—only if your user account has one of the following [user roles](../../prepare/users-roles.md#user-roles):

* Administrator
* Owner
* Power User

Users maintain the ability to modify any changes you make to their notifications.

Notifications belong to the customer account where they are created. If you manage other accounts and want to subscribe users in a managed account, you need to switch to the users' account.

You can set up a user account and designate it as "Notification Target Only," which means it exists only for email notifications. You can use this notification target to receive and store notifications for later review, or you can use a distribution list as the contact email so multiple people get the emails. For more information see [Create a user account as a notification target](../../prepare/users-roles.md#notification-target).
