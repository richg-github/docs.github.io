# Log Search Notification

Use cases from wiki:

* As a Security Analyst, I can schedule, receive and manage notification on the completion of Saved Searches, including sending these notifications to other members of my team.
* As a customer who created a scheduled search, I want to receive notifications when the search is completed and notify other members of my department.
* As an AWP Analyst who create a scheduled search for my customers, I want to receive notifications when the search is completed with its results and notify my customer's contacts as well.
