# Observation Notifications

When a log [correlation](log-correlation.md) occurs that meets specific criteria, Alert Logic  can send you, other subscribed users, or a configured [connector](../connectors.md) (such as a webhook) an observation notification.

For more information about the Notifications feature in the Alert Logic console, see [Notifications](../notifications.md) and [Manage Notifications](manage.md).

## Create an observation notification

When you create a correlation, you can set up a notification in the next step. You can also add  notifications to a correlation at any time.

To create a correlation and add an observation notification:

If the log correlation for which you want to send notifications is not created yet, when you [create the correlation](log-correlation.md#Create),  select **Observation** as the type of correlation result to generate.

When you click **SAVE AND CONTINUE**, the Create an Observation Notification page opens with the correlation already added as a notification filter.

To add an observation notification to an existing correlation:

From the Search page, listed under ![](../../Resources/Images/dashboard/investigate-icon.png)**Investigate** in the Alert Logic console, click the **Correlations** tab to open the [Correlations page](log-correlation.md#View). Find the Observation type correlation for which  to add the notification, click **Preview**, and then do either of the following:

From the **Search** page, click the **Correlations** tab to open the [Correlations page](log-correlation.md#View). Find the Observation type correlation for which  to add the notification, click **Preview**, and then do either of the following:

* Click **+ADD** in the Notifications area of the detail view.
* Click the **EDIT** icon in the detail view, and then click **SAVE AND CONTINUE** in the Edit a Correlation page.

Using either of these methods, the Create an Observation Notification page opens with the correlation already added as a notification filter.

**To complete the Create an Observation Notification page:**

1. Type a descriptive name for the observation notificationâ€”for example, "Admin Failed Login Correlation."
2. Ensure  the correlation that you are creating the notification for is selected under **Correlation Rule**.
3. To subscribe users to receive a notification email, click **Subscribe User(s)**, and then, under **Notification Delivery**:
   1. Select the users that you want to receive the notification. The list includes your name and user names  in the managed accounts selected above, if applicable. You can use the search bar to help you find recipients.
   2. (Optional) Customize the **Email Subject**. You can change the text and insert  variables enclosed with double braces: {{*variable*}}. For the variable list, see [Email subject variables](#Emailsubjectvariables).
5. To subscribe a connector, click **Subscribe Connector**, and then, under **Notification Delivery**, select a configured connector. The connector URL will receive the payload listed.
6. Click **SAVE**.
