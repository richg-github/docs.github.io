# File Integrity Monitoring Search Notification

Alert Logic offers File Integrity Monitoring (FIM), which allows you to monitor changes to files and directories of assets associated with your Alert Logic deployments in the Alert Logic console. You can configure monitoring or exclusions for specific file paths or entire directories  in your Windows and Linux systems.  To learn more about FIM, see [File Integrity Monitoring ](../file-integrity-monitoring.md).

You can also  view the File Integrity Monitoring dashboard for a summary of your file monitoring activity. For more information, see [File Integrity Monitoring Dashboard ](../../analyze/dashboard/file-integrity-monitoring.md).

After you set up FIM, you can schedule a weekly or monthly search of changes to your FIM setups, and be notified when the search is complete. The search and notification can help you keep records of changes to your systems, which can also help you with PCI-DSS compliance requirements.
