# Connectors and Connection Targets Resources (Beta)

    This document is intended for early-access customers, and it is updated as  features are enhanced.     
The Alert Logic console is presenting a new tab under configure, connection targets. Connection targets are the authentication URL and credentials used for 3rd party integrations.

The URLÂ path and credential fields in the old connectors configuration are now found in the Connection Targets configuration. In the connectors configuration, you will now select a reusable connection target to set basic URL, credential, and header parameters. Automated response playbooks use connection targets for integration.
