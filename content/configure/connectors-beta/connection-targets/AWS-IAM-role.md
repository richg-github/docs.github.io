# Configure AWS IAM Role Connection Target

A AWS IAM Role connection target securely stores reusable authentication credential and URL path information for integrations with AWS IAM Role.

Complete the following steps to  configure a connection target for AWS IAM Role:

1. [Create an  AWS IAM Role ARN](#CreateanAWSIAMRoleARN)
2. [Use the connection target in  playbooks](#Usetheconncectiontargetinplaybooks)

## Create an  AWS IAM Role ARN

For Amazon Web Services (AWS) IAM Role connection targets,  you must generate a Role ARN value. For more information, see [Configure  IAM Role for Amazon Web Services (AWS) ](../../../prepare/iam-role-creation.md).

## Use the connection target in  playbooks

After you save the connection target, the last step is to set up a connector or automated response playbook. For more information on connectors, see [Connectors Configuration Guide](../../../Z-Sandbox/bbaskin/connectors-beta/connectors.md). For more information on automated response, see [Get Started with Automated Response (Beta)](../../../respond/automated-response.md).

## Manage connection targets

You can view the list of connection targets and edit or delete an existing one. For more information, see [Manage Connection Targets](../../../Z-Sandbox/bbaskin/connectors-beta/connection-targets/manage-connection-targets.md).
