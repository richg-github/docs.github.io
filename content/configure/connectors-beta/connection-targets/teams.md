# Configure Microsoft Teams Connection Target

A Microsoft Teams connection target securely stores reusable authentication credential and URL path information for integrations with Microsoft Teams.

Complete the following steps to  configure a connection target for Microsoft Teams:

1. [Generate your Teams base target URL](#GeneratethetargetURL)
2. [Use the connection target in connectors and playbooks](#Usetheconnectiontargetinconnectorsandplaybooks)

## Generate your Teams base target URL

The base URL for Microsoft Teams connection targets must be generated from Teams. To generate the base target URL, complete the instructions in the [Microsoft Teams documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook#add-an-incoming-webhook-to-a-teams-channel).

**To set up a simple connection target**:

Copy the entire generated URL, which you must paste into the base URL field in the Alert Logic console later. You will not need to add additional target URL information in the [Configure Microsoft Teams Webhook Connector](../teams.md) or [Playbook Task Configuration Guide (Beta)](../../../respond/automated-response/task-configuration-guide.md) configurations.

**To set up a generic connection target for multiple integrations with Teams**:

Copy only the base URL path information from the URL generated by Teams. For example, "https://outlook.office.com/" or "https://outlook.office.com/webhook". You will need to specify exact URL target information in the [Configure Microsoft Teams Webhook Connector](../teams.md) or [Playbook Task Configuration Guide (Beta)](../../../respond/automated-response/task-configuration-guide.md) configurations. For example, "/<unique-integration-id>".

## Create the Microsoft Teams connection target from the Alert Logic console

1. In the Alert Logic console, click the navigation menu icon (![](../../../Resources/Images/dashboard/menu-icon.png)), click ![](../../../Resources/Images/dashboard/configure-icon.png)**Configure**, and then click **Connectors**.
2. Click on the **Connection Targets** tab.
3. On the Connection Targets page, click the add icon (![](../../../Resources/Images/Icons/cdAddPlus.png)), and then click **Microsoft Teams**.
4. On the Create a Microsoft Teams Connection Target page, type a descriptive name for the connection target —for example, "Microsoft Teams Connection Target".
5. In  **Base URL**, use the URL you identified earlier.
6. Activate the connection target if you want to use it, or leave it inactive to save the connection target for later.
7. Click **SAVE**.

## Use the connection target in connectors and playbooks

After you save the connection target, the last step is to set up a connector or automated response playbook. For more information on connectors, see [Connectors Configuration Guide](../../../Z-Sandbox/bbaskin/connectors-beta/connectors.md). For more information on automated response, see [Get Started with Automated Response (Beta)](../../../respond/automated-response.md).

## Manage connection targets

You can view the list of connection targets and edit or delete an existing one. For more information, see [Manage Connection Targets](../../../Z-Sandbox/bbaskin/connectors-beta/connection-targets/manage-connection-targets.md).
