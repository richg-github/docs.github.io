# Connection Targets Configuration Guide (Beta)

    This document is intended for early-access customers, and it is updated as  features are enhanced.     
Connection targets define common authentication path and credential references for external systems. Connection targets are stored securely and can be used by connectors and automated response workflows.

For more information on connectors, see [Connectors Configuration Guide](../../connectors/connectors.md). For more information on automated response, see [Get Started with Automated Response (Beta)](../../../respond/automated-response.md).
