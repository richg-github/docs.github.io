# Configure Google Cloud Platform Log Collector 

The Alert Logic Google Cloud Platform collector is an AWS-based API Poll (PAWS) log collector library mechanism designed to collect logs from the Google Cloud logs, formerly referred to as Stackdriver. You must generate a Google API, apply the permissions, and then complete the configuration process in the Alert Logic console.

Google Cloud logs do not have host metadata and are formatted in JSON. If you want to collect syslogs, you must use the Alert Logic agent to allow Alert Logic to process them. For more information about how to install the Alert Logic agent, see [Install the Alert Logic Agent for Windows](../../prepare/alert-logic-agent-windows.md) or [Install the Alert Logic Agent for Linux](../../prepare/alert-logic-agent-linux.md)

You can find Google Cloud Platform logs collected with keyword search in the Alert Logic console [Search:Â Log Messages](../../analyze/log-message-search.md) page.

Although Alert Logic does not recommend using a Virtual Machine (VM) instance to forward logs to Google Cloud, if you want to collect logs from a VM, you must use a Google logging agent. The Google logging agent sends logs to the VM parent project by default. You must override and send to another project. To learn more about the Google logging agent, see [About the Logging agent](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/agent).

## Generate a Google API in Google Cloud Platform

In the Google Cloud Platform console, you must complete a few key tasks for logs to be collected from Google Cloud.

**You must generate a Google API key file**:

1. In the [Google Cloud Platform console,](https://console.cloud.google.com/) on the side panel, click **IAM &amp; admin**, and then click **Service accounts**.
2. Click **CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT**.
3. In the **Service account name** field, enter a name.
4. (Optional) In the **Service account description** field, and a description.
5. Click **CREATE**.
6. From the **Select a role** drop-down list, select **Logging**, and then **Private Logs Viewer**.
7. Click **Continue**.
8. (Optional) Grant user permissions if necessary, and then click **DONE**.
The Role field authorizes your service account to access resources. You can view and change this field later in the Google Cloud Platform console. If you are developing a production app, specify more granular permissions than Private Logs Viewer. For more information, see [granting roles to service accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-roles-to-service-accounts).
9. Under **Actions**, click the ![](../../Resources/Images/Icons/settings.png) icon, and then click **Create key**.
10. Select **JSON**, and then click **Create**. A JSON file that contains your key downloads to your computer. Note the location of JSON file, which you will need later.

## Configuring collection from the Alert Logic console

After you generate your JSON key, you must complete the log configuration process in  the Alert Logic console. This configuration is an account-level integration, which means you can configure more than one instance of Google Cloud collection. This capability is useful when  more than one instance of the application exists.

To access the Application Registry page, click the menu icon (![](../../Resources/Images/dashboard/menu-icon.png)) from the Dashboards page. Click ![](../../Resources/Images/dashboard/configure-icon.png)**Configure**, and then click **Application Registry**.

**To add a new application collection**:

1. In the Application Registry click the **Google Cloud** tile, and then click Google Cloud Platform.
2. In the **Application Name** field, enter a name for this Google Cloud collection instance.
3. Under Collection Method and Policy, in the **Resource identifiers** field,  enter Google resources from which you want to poll logs. Each element must follow the format <resourceType>/<resourceID> and must be on its own line. 
Other formatting examples:
   * projects/<PROJECT_ID>
   * organizations/<ORGANIZATION_ID>
   * billingAccounts/<BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID>
   * folders/<FOLDER_ID>
5. In the **Service Account JSON key** field, enter the contents of the JSON file that you downloaded previously from generating a key.
6. (Optional) Enter a **Collection Start** time using a format such as (2020-01-01T16:00:00Z). If the **Collection Start** field is left blank, only logs generated after you configure this collection instance will be collected.             
The collection start time determines how far back you want Alert Logic to collect logs if data already exists in your account. Alert Logic can only collect logs up to 30 days prior to the date you configured this collection instance.
7. Click **ADD**.Wait a few minutes for the application to create and appear in your application list. Do not click **ADD** again.

In the Applications List tab, if you configured your application correctly, within approximately 10 minutes you will see Configured next to the application. For more information about how to add instances or manage existing collecting applications, see [Manage your configured applications](../application-registry.md#Configur).

## Security Content for incidents

17. Alert Logic builds collectors to capture data from various applications, with the goal of creating security content that is used to generate incidents for key security use cases. As of now, the Security Content team is determining which type incidents can be created for the Google Cloud platform. This information will be made available and updated on this page later in 2020.
