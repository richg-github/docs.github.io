# Configure Microsoft Office 365 Log Collector

The instructions in this document are for the Alert Logic [Application Registry](../application-registry.md) setup  of the Microsoft Office 365 log collector. If you have to reference instructions or information for the older setup of the log collector, see [Set Up Collection of Microsoft Office 365 Logs](../../prepare/office365-log-collector.md).

The Alert Logic Microsoft Office 365 collector is an AWS-based API Poll (PAWS) log collector library mechanism designed to collect logs. You can find Office 365 logs collected with keyword search in the Alert Logic console [Search: Log Messages](../../analyze/log-message-search.md) page. Alert Logic also generates security incidents from Office 365 logs in the [Incidents](../../analyze/incidents.md) page. For more information about authentication application security content, see [Authentication Application Security Incidents](../../analyze/security-incidents.md).

The Alert Logic Microsoft Office 365 collector can collect from these specific Office 365 content streams:

* Audit logs from Azure Active Directory
* Audit logs from Microsoft Office 365 Exchange
* Audit logs from SharePoint
* General audit logs

A single Office 365 collector can collect logs from any or all the content streams that you configure in the Alert Logic console. These audit logs are collected through Microsoft Stream. For more information on Microsoft Stream, go to [Audit logs in Microsoft Stream](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/stream/audit-logs).

You must complete the following to successfully configure your Office 365 Log Collector:

1. [Register a new Office 365 web application](#Register)
2. [Set up Active Directory security permissions](#Set)
3. [Configure collection in the Alert Logic console](#Configur)

## Register a new Office 365 web application

In the Office 365 portal, you must register a new Office 365 web application to collect Office 365 logs.

**To register an Office 365 web application:**

1. Log into the [Office 365 portal](https://portal.office.com/) as an Active Directory tenant administrator.
2. In the left menu,  click **Azure Active Directory**.
3. Select **App Registrations**, and then click **+ New application registration**.
4. Provide the following information in the fields:
   * Enter a name for the application —for example, alo365collector.
   * Under **Supported account types**, select **Single tenant** .
   * Under **Redirect URI (optional)**, leave the Redirect URI field blank.
6. Click **Register**. Note the Application (client) ID, for example, a261478c-84fb-42f9-84c2-de050a4babe3, and the Directory (tenant) ID.

## Set up Active Directory security permissions

You must set up Active Directory security permissions for the application you created so it can read threat intelligence data and activity reports for your organization.

**To set up Active Directory permissions:**

1. On the main panel under the new application, click **View API Permissions**, and then click **+ Add a permission**.
2. Locate and click **Office 365 Management APIs**, and then click **Select**.
3. In **Application permissions**, expand and select **ActivityFeed.Read**, **ActivityReports.ReadDlp**, and **ServiceHealth.Read**.
4. Ensure all necessary permissions are selected, and then click **Add permissions**.
5. Click **Grant admin consent**, and then click **Accept** to confirm.
      Only the Active Directory tenant administrator can grant permissions to an Azure Active Directory application.      7. On the left navigation area, select **Certificates &amp; secrets**, and then click **+ New client secret**.
8. Type a key **Description** and set the expiration to **Never**.
9. Click **Add**.
10. Save the value (client secret), which you will need later.

## Configure collection in the Alert Logic console

After you register a new Office 365 application and set up permissions, you must complete the log collection configuration process in the Alert Logic console. This configuration is an account-level integration, which means you can configure more than one instance of Office 365 collection. This capability is useful when  more than one instance of the application exists.

To access the Application Registry page, click the menu icon (![](../../Resources/Images/dashboard/menu-icon.png)) from the Dashboards page. Click ![](../../Resources/Images/dashboard/configure-icon.png)**Configure**, and then click **Application Registry**.

**To add a new application collection**:

1. In the Application Registry, click the **Microsoft** tile, and then under **Productivity Applications**, click Office 365** Logs**.
2. In the **Application Name** field, enter a name for this Office 365 collection instance.
3. Under Collection Method and Policy, in the **Client ID** field, enter the Azure Client ID associated with your registered Office 365 application.
4. In the **Client Secret**, enter your client secret.
5. In the **Tenant ID** field, enter your tenant ID. To find your Office 365 tenant ID, see [Find your Office 365 tenant ID](https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/find-your-office-365-tenant-id-6891b561-a52d-4ade-9f39-b492285e2c9b).
6. Select the content streams from which you want to collect logs.
7. (Optional) Enter a **Collection Start** time using a format such as (2020-01-01T16:00:00Z). If the **Collection Start** field is left blank, only logs generated after you configure this collection instance will be collected.             
The collection start time determines how far back you want Alert Logic to collect logs if data already exists in your account. Alert Logic can only collect logs up to 30 days prior to the date you configured this collection instance.
8. Click **ADD**.Wait a few minutes for the application to create and appear in your application list. Do not click **ADD** again.                      Alert Logic Office 365 accounts for some third-party product APIs that may fail if attempting to pull log data for an older timeframe that is not available. The Alert Logic Office 365 collector does not attempt an invalid request to the API, and instead moves the target collection date to the earliest valid date available.

In the Applications List tab, if you configured your application correctly, within approximately 10 minutes you will Configured next to the application. For more information about how to add instances or manage existing collecting applications, see [Manage your configured applications](../application-registry.md#Configur).

## Security content for Incidents

Alert Logic builds collectors to capture data from Office 365 and various other applications to create security content that is used to generate incidents for key security use cases. The following security incidents are available for Office 365:

* Administrative Actions
* User Login AD
* User Behavior AD

For more information about authentication application security content, see [Authentication Application Security Incidents](../../analyze/security-incidents.md).
