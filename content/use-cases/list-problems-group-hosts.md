# Download a List of Problems for a Group of Hostsâ€‹

<p>The <MadCap:variable name="SDKVariables.CLI" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd" /> can be used to retrieve a list of exposures reported against a group of hosts; whether by network, subnet, or deployment (and by extension cloud account).</p>

<MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/sub-typess-ess-pro.flsnp" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd" /><MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/req-cli-installed.flsnp" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd" />## Technical Details

<p>
  <MadCap:variable name="SDKVariables.Company" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd" /> reports configuration and security exposures against the assets in a deployment and these exposures are related to the assets they concern in the Assets model.  The <MadCap:variable name="SDKVariables.CLI" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd" /> can utilize these relationships to retrieve exposures for a group of hosts belonging to the same network or to the same deployment (and by extension cloud account).</p>

## Download a list of problems for a group of hosts by cloud account

A cloud account (AWS or Azure) and a deployment have a one-to-one relationship; to retrieve a list of problems for hosts in a given cloud account, restrict the query to the deployment covering that cloud account.

<p>Use the <MadCap:variable name="SDKVariables.CLI" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd" /> to retrieve a list of host vulnerabilities in a given deployment:</p>

```

</table>## Download a list of problems for a group of hosts by network

To retrieve a list of vulnerabilities for a group of hosts by network, include the <kbd>'network' </kbd>asset type in the command (or <kbd>'vpc'</kbd> -- the former is an alias for the latter).  Filtering can be performed on any of the network asset's properties: for example, filtering by asset key can be achieved with e.g.<kbd> --filter '{"network.key": "/aws/ap-northeast-1/host/i-0d276a2ed22c7f784"}'</kbd>; likewise, filtering by CIDR range (especially useful for DC deployments) can be achieved with e.g. <kbd>--filter '{"network.cidr_ranges": "&amp;gt;&amp;gt;10.22.30.0/24"}'</kbd> which uses the list membership operator <kbd>'&amp;gt;&amp;gt;'</kbd> to check that the provided CIDR range is present in the network asset's list of CIDR ranges.

<p>Use the <MadCap:variable name="SDKVariables.CLI" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd" /> to download a list of problems for hosts in a given network:</p>

The same method can be used to retrieve a list of vulnerabilities for hosts in a given subnet: use the 'subnet' asset type in place of 'network', and filter based on its properties.
