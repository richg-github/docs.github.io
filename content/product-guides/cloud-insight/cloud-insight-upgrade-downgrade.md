# Change the Assessment Level of a Cloud Insight Deployment 

If you want to enable scanning for a Cloud Insight Essentials deployment, or disable scanning for a Cloud Insight deployment, Alert Logic allows you to do so quickly through the Deployments page.

## Upgrade from Cloud Insight Essentials to Cloud Insight

To enable scanning for a Cloud Insight Essentials deployment, you can edit the security policy in AWS. Then, in Cloud Insight Essentials, edit the deployment and change the level of assessment to Cloud Insight.

A Cloud Insight deployment allows Alert Logic to spin up AWS subnets and instances in your AWS infrastructure, which incurs additional costs from Alert Logic for scanning per host, and additional costs from AWS for the instances Alert Logic creates.

    Do not use CloudFormation Setup to create an IAM role when you upgrade a deployment from Cloud Insight Essentials to Cloud Insight.    1. Click **CONTINUE**.
2. Click **SAVE**.
