# Log Management Challenges

Many compliance mandates, such as PCI DSS, require not only that you collect all logs, but that they be reviewed regularly, are searchable, and are stored in their original, unaltered, raw form for mandate-specific timeframes.

Logs can also be extremely useful in identifying security incidents, policy violations, fraudulent activity, and operational problems shortly after they occur. They are extremely valuable when performing audits, forensic analysis, internal investigations, establishing baselines, and identifying operational trends and long-term problems. However, the infinite variety of log data formats makes it impossible to utilize the data without data normalization.

It is reasonable to assume that the variety of log data sources and the volume of data will always increase. Compounding this challenge is the variability of data formats and distributed nature of these sources; in addition, every network infrastructure is in a constant state of change, with new systems, applications, users, and devices every day of the year.

This creates a variety of specific challenges for log management efforts. These challenges can be broken down into three areas: collection, analysis and review, and archival.
