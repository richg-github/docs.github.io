# Deployment Assets

introduction here

## Networks

A  network is a range of IP addresses, expressed in CIDR notation, that you want to monitor within your network. A  network cannot monitor a range of IP addresses larger than a /8 CIDR.

To monitor a  network, you must apply the network to a monitoring policy. You may apply multiple networks to a monitoring policy. For more information about monitoring policies, see .

### Create and protect networks

The  networks feature allows you to create and protect networks.

To create and protect a network:

1. At the top of the Alert Logic console, from the drop-down menu, click **Threat Manager**.
2. In the left navigation area, under **Detection**, click **Networks**.
3. In the table of networks, in the **Actions** column, click the gear icon (![](../Resources/Images/Icons/gear icon.png)), and then select **Protect Networks**.
4. In the **Name** box, type a name for the network.
5. In the **CIDR** box, type the network CIDR information.
6. To assign tags to your network, in the **Tags** box, type one or more tags.
7. To monitor the network immediately, select the appliance that you want to monitor the network.
8. Click **Save**.

If you do not select an appliance, the configuration status of your network appears as "unprotected." To protect this network at a later time, you must assign it to a monitoring policy, and then assign the monitoring policy to an appliance. For more information about monitoring policies, see .

## Certificates, keys, and SSLÂ decryptor

If you enable Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)Â entitlement for your Alert Logic account, you can create certificates, which Threat Manager automatically assigns to your appliances.

To use this feature, you must enable SSL entitlement for your account, and you must have permission to manage certificates and keys.

To access Certificates and Keys:

1. At the top of the Alert Logic console, from the drop-down menu, click **Threat Manager**.
2. In the left navigation area, under **Detection**, click **Certificates &amp; Keys**.

If you do not see the **Certificates &amp; Keys** section in the user interface, you do not have access to this feature. 

To use this feature, contact Alert Logic by e-mail at support@alertlogic.com or by phone (US: (877) 484-8383, UK: +44 (0) 203 011 5533).

**SSL certificates and keys**

SSL is the standard mechanism used to secure communication on the web, and SSL helps secure information, such as credit card numbers, personal information, and private data.  At the most basic level, an SSL-enabled web server uses certificates and private keys to establish a secure and encrypted connection with web browsers.

The private key is the necessary component to decrypt the entire SSL connection. Guard the private key as carefully as a password. Alert Logic uses an industry-standard key encryption mechanism to store private keys.

A certificate matches a key, and the certificate provides authenticated identity information to web browsers and other client software. Certificates present authentication information during the establishment of a secure SSL connection, so certificates are considered public information.

Threat Manager allows you to upload your SSL certificate and corresponding key. This action allows  the SSL decryptor to decrypt traffic for further analysis.

Alert Logic** SSL Decryptor**

The Alert Logic SSL Decryptor extends the advanced intrusion detection capabilities of Threat Manager. The decryptor allows the appliance to inspect the encrypted SSL traffic.

Alert Logic* SSL Decryptor Setup Requirements and Process*

The SSL Decryptor setup process requires the following:

* A copy of the SSL certificate for the protected site exported to .PEM format without a passphrase.

When you upload certificates and private keys to the Alert Logic console, you provide a secure and encrypted communication between your web browser and Alert Logic servers. In addition, Alert Logic stores private keys through an industry-standard key encryption mechanism. Because Alert Logic software handles the key automatically and securely, you need not upload the private key with a passphrase. If you previously saved your unencrypted private key to a file, Alert Logic strongly recommends you destroy the key immediately after you upload the key.

* The TCP/IP address and port on your system that you want to monitor, and that you associated with your SSL certificate.  For example, 10.10.10.17 is your IP address on port 443.

*Maintenance of the SSLÂ decryption on the *Threat Manager* appliance*

The Alert Logic SSL Decryptor requires the SSL certificate information to detect possible intrusions in encrypted channels.  SSLÂ certificates expire. A renewed SSLÂ certificate requires an update to the certificate information in the Alert Logic console.

Alert Logic does not support any cipher that uses Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocols. This includes the use of Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS).

If you change the certificate for a protected device, but do not change the certificate SSL Decryptor, the Decryptor cannot examine SSL traffic for that site.

### Add a certificate

To inspect SSL-encrypted traffic, you must upload a certificate through the Alert Logic console. After you add a certificate, it will automatically be assigned to all appliances.

Alert Logic does not support any cipher that uses Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocols. This includes the use of Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS).

To add a certificate:

1. At the top of the Alert Logic console, from the drop-down menu, click **Threat Manager**.
2. In the left navigation area, under **Detection**, click **Certificates &amp; Keys**.
3. In the table of certificates, in the **Actions** column, click the gear icon (![](../Resources/Images/Icons/gear icon.png)).
4. Select **Add Certificate**.
5. Complete the fields with the appropriate information:
   * **Name**â€”A descriptive name to identify the certificate.
   * **Certificate Content**â€”The PEM-encoded certificate. 
   This field must  include the header and footer notes.
   * **Private Key Content**â€”The PEM-encoded private key. 
   This field must include the header and footer notes.
   The PEM-encoded private key must be in RSA format, or you must convert the key to RSA format.

**Correct format for the Add Certificate page**

* Include "----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY----" and "----END RSA PRIVATE KEY----" in Private Key Content.
* Include "----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----" and "----END CERTIFICATE----" in Certificate Content.

The following shows an example of valid certificate format:

![](../Resources/Images/certAppleTextEditor.png)
You can upload a PEM file instead of completing the empty fields. To upload a PEMÂ file, click **Browse** in the **PEM File Upload** field and then search for and select the desired PEM file.
Your PEM file must have both certificate information and private key information.

1. Click **Save**.

Allow about 15 minutes for your system to update with these changes.

### View certificate information

Threat Manager allows you to view information for public certificates. Alert Logic protects confidential private keys, so you cannot retrieve or view private keys.

To view information about a certificate:

1. At the top of the Alert Logic console, from the drop-down menu, click **Threat Manager**.
2. In the left navigation area, under **Detection**, click **Certificates &amp; Keys**.
3. In the table of certificates, within the corresponding  row, place your cursor in the **Actions** column.
4. Click **View**.

Information, which includes the name of the certificate, the host IP address, the host port, and the certificate key, appears on the right side of the screen.

### Delete a certificate

Threat Manager allows you to delete uploaded certificates.

When you delete a certificate, you delete the corresponding key, which means Alert Logic can no longer decrypt the SSL-encrypted traffic associated with the deleted certificate and private key.

To delete a certificate:

1. At the top of the Alert Logic console, from the drop-down menu, click **Threat Manager**.
2. In the left navigation area, under **Detection**, click **Certificates &amp; Keys**.
3. In the table of certificates, within the corresponding row, place your cursor under the **Actions** column and click the trash icon (![](../Resources/Images/Icons/trash icon.png)).
4. Click **Delete**.

Allow about 15 minutes for your system to update with these changes.
