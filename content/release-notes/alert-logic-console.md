# Alert Logic Console Release Notes

## Alert Logic console release notes

    2022    ### Release date: February ?, 2022

[Release note about the new Monthly Log Review Details report...]

Alert Logic also released enhancements to scheduled reports:

* For weekly and monthly report schedules, you can now schedule a report on a specific day of the week or month.
* A new Run Once option, available for non-interactive reports like the Monthly Log Review Details report, allows you to generate the report immediately instead of at a scheduled time.
* Some reports now have schedule windows. Limiting available schedule times avoids generating empty or incomplete reports, which occurred previously if affected reports were scheduled before the data refresh completed.
* New report options allow you to choose the report format and type of data to include in the generated report.

You may notice that Alert Logic adjusted some existing report schedules for you, either to comply with a valid time range or to use a report option that makes a report easier to consume. If you prefer a different time or report option, you can edit the report schedule.
