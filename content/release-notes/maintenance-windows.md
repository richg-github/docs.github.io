* **US:** Monday – Friday, 8 PM – 3 AM (Central Time)

    Completion times for updates vary based on data size.    ## Emergency change window

Alert Logic notifies you when emergency changes are required. Alert Logic works to complete emergency changes as quickly as possible, and with the least interruption to your service.

## Major change window

* **US:** Saturday 8 PM – Sunday 3 AM (Central Time)
* **UK:** Saturday 9 PM – Sunday 4 AM (UTC)

Because some major changes can cause service interruptions, Alert Logic communicates these changes to you at least six business days in advance of the change.
