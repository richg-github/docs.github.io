# Search Help Fields

The Alert Logic console provides a help library of search templates and fields to help you create effective log searches that address the security concerns and goals for your organization. You can then save your searches for later use with the Save Search feature.

## About search templates

You have access to all the search fields in the  help library. When you use a search template, you must substitute the placeholder text with values relevant to your search.

Templates are organized into the different data types, which help organize fields by the type of data. Use the search field and the field drop-down list to help narrow down available search fields in that data type.

To use a search field:

1. In the Log Search page, place your cursor in the query where you want the field placed.
2. Click **Help**.
3. Select and expand the data type that contains the search field you want to use.
4. Click the search field you want to use.
5. Replace the placeholder text with values relevant to your search.
6. Click **SEARCH**.

After you enter your values into a search template, you can choose to save the search for future use. For more information, see [Saved and Schedule Searches](save-schedule.md).
