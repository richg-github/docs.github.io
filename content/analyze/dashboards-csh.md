# About Dashboards

Dashboards introduces interactive, visual dashboards that summarize data, product capabilities, and the state of your environment. These dashboards are being released together with an easy way to  navigate through the Alert Logic console.

Dashboards allows you to easily view pertinent information  in  visuals that feed from live data in your environment. Most visuals allow you to click items to view the source of the data  in the visual. This allows you to drill down further into issues immediately  on the corresponding page in the Alert Logic console, and streamline your response actions.

## Navigation menu

The Dashboards navigation menu makes it easy to navigate through the Alert Logic console from the Dashboards page.

**To start navigating to other pages**:

1. Click the menu icon (![](../Resources/Images/dashboard/menu-icon.png)) to see the navigation menu.
2. Click on a navigation group (for example, **Respond**) to expand the options under that group.
3. Click on a navigation item (for example, **Incidents**) that you want to explore further.

For more detailed information, go to [Managed Detection and Response Navigation Menu Updates](dashboard/navigation.md#Navigation).

## Available Dashboards

Alert Logic curated different dashboards, which are composed of visualizations to present how you interact with data and capabilities in your environment, and quickly track existing issues.   The default dashboard view is Threat Summary. You can use the drop-down menu on the top left to view the other available dashboards. The following are some available dashboards:

* [Threat Summary Dashboard](dashboard/threat-summary.md)
* [Vulnerability Summary Dashboard](dashboard/vulnerability-summary.md)
* [Coverage and Health Dashboard](dashboard/coverage-health.md)
* [Endpoint Protection Dashboard](dashboard/endpoint-protection.md)
* [Web Log Analytics Dashboard](dashboard/web-log-analytics.md)

### Visuals in the dashboards

Some visuals in the dashboards can redirect you to the corresponding page in the Alert Logic console where you can take further action if necessary. Click **INVESTIGATE** or **CONFIGURE** in the visual to go directly to that source page in the Alert Logic console with the data already filtered for you. You can also hover over an item in a visual to see a detailed level, and a tool-tip.

For visuals with information in a list, you can click **EXPORT TO CSV** to export the data in CSV  format.
