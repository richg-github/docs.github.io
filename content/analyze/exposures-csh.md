# About Exposures

The Exposure page provides a list of exposures, details about the exposure, evidence, affected assets, and a list of remediations to resolve an exposure, or a group of exposures. Use this information to analyze and address exposures found in your environment.

## Threat Levels

Exposures uses  icons to help you identify the threat levels of an exposure. See the threat level categories below:

* ![](../Resources/Images/Icons/threat_critical_icon.png) High
* ![](../Resources/Images/Icons/threat_high_icon.png) Medium
* ![](../Resources/Images/Icons/threat_medium_icon.png) Low
* ![](../Resources/Images/Icons/threat_info_icon.png) Info

## Category

There are two types of exposures categoryâ€”security and configuration that Alert Logic lists in the Exposures page.

* **Security exposures** are issues related to vulnerabilities identified in a scan, such as an attack or vulnerability that can lead to a breach if not addressed.
* **Configuration exposures** are issues related to your deployment  can hinder Alert Logic from delivering service properly.

## Open Exposures 

The Exposures page, by default, will list individual, open exposures. You can also  view open remediations,  which provide a recommended action to resolve one or multiple exposures. To view the list of remediations, click **Organize by Remediation**.

On the left-hand filter, you can select one or more available filters to narrow your list of items. Click **Dispose** to view items removed from the list, or click **Concluded** to view items that are considered resolved.

## Exposures actions

* **Dispose**:  To hide an item(s) and exclude their calculated vulnerability risks from your environment, select one or more items (exposures or remediations), and then click the Dispose icon (![](../Resources/Images/General/Icons/Remediations/disposed.png)).
* **Conclude**:To verify that an item(s) will no longer appear in the next scan, select one or more items, and then click the Conclude icon (![](../Resources/Images/General/Icons/Remediations/complete.png)).
* **Preview**: To expand and see important details on an item, click **Preview**.
* **Open**:  To go to the Detail page, and see more information on an item, click **Open**.
