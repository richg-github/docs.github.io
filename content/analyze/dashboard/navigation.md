# Managed Detection and Response Navigation Menu Updates

In early 2020, Alert Logic released a new navigation system for the Alert Logic console, as well as a set of interactive, visual dashboards that summarize data, product capabilities, and the state of your environment. For more information, see [Dashboards](../dashboards.md).

## The new navigation menu

The new navigation menu is located on the left side of the page under a menu icon (![](../../Resources/Images/dashboard/menu-icon.png)), and the options are nested.

**To navigate between pages**:

1. Click the menu icon (![](../../Resources/Images/dashboard/menu-icon.png)) to see the navigation menu.
2. Click on a navigation group (for example, **Respond**) to expand the options under that group.
3. Click on a navigation item (for example, **Incidents**) that you want to explore further.
4. Click the menu icon  (![](../../Resources/Images/dashboard/menu-icon.png)) again to collapse the menu and view the page.

## New page locations in the Alert Logic console

Although all of the functionality of the prior Alert Logic console is available, there are some differences in the new navigation menu.

See the table below for a comparison of the new navigation menu and the prior organization of the Alert Logic console:

### Improved functionality

Dashboards replaced the existing Security Posture and Remediations pages with new and improved functionality.

To learn more about the dashboard features replacing the Security Posture page, see [About the dashboards](../dashboards.md#About).

The [Remediations](../remediations.md) page was replaced by Exposures. The Exposures page allows you to filter, view, and take action on individual or groups of exposures, as well as remediations. To learn more, see [Exposures](../exposures.md).
