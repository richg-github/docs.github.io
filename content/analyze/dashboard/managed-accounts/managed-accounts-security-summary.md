# Managed Accounts Security Summary Dashboard

The Managed Accounts Security Summary dashboard provides insights into the recent security status of the accounts you manage. The visuals includes information about incidents, vulnerabilities, Threat Risk Index (TRI) scores, and security remediations. Use this dashboard to quickly identify risky accounts, patterns, and anomalies that require immediate response or further investigations. This dashboard includes visuals of the following data:

* Total accounts with critical and high incidents
* Change amount and percentage of current high severity vulnerabilities, the average TRI score, and the average age of vulnerabilities
* Scorecards of incidents and vulnerabilities data for each account
* Top accounts with the most incidents, highest TRI scores, most vulnerabilities, and most security remediations

The Managed Accounts Security Summary Dashboard is an additional dashboard only offered to partners and customers with managed accounts. To learn about the other dashboard offered to partners and customers with managed accounts, see [Managed Accounts Health Summary Dashboard](managed-accounts-security-summary.md/managed-accounts/managed-accounts-health-summary.md). For customers with single accounts, see [Dashboards](../../dashboards.md).
