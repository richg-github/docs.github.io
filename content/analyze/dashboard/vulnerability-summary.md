# Vulnerability Summary Dashboard

The Vulnerability Summary dashboard provides visibility into vulnerable software and cloud infrastructure in your environment. Use this dashboard to gain insights into the effectiveness of your current vulnerability management efforts, learn about new vulnerabilities and emerging threats, help prioritize your remediation plans, and focus on specific areas in your environment. This dashboard includes visuals of the following data:

* Vulnerability, exposure, and remediation counts
* Vulnerability severity trends
* Vulnerabilities by threat levels
* Vulnerabilities by deployments
* Top security remediations
* Most seen exposures
* Most vulnerable hosts

The Vulnerability Summary is a new dashboard that is part of the Dashboard feature. For more information about Dashboards, see [Dashboards](../dashboards.md).

## Access the Vulnerability Summary dashboard

To access the Vulnerability Summary dashboard,  in the Alert Logic console, in the Dashboards page, click the drop-down menu on the top left to see the list of available dashboards, and then click **Vulnerability Summary**.

## Vulnerability Summary visuals

If available, you can click **INVESTIGATE** in the visuals to be redirected to the corresponding page in the Alert Logic console and to take further action if necessary. You can also hover over an item in a visual to see a tooltip with additional details. You can also click items in the visuals to be redirected to the corresponding page in the Alert Logic console and to take further action if necessary.  The corresponding page is already filtered with the data from the visual you clicked.
