# Endpoint Protection Dashboard

The Endpoint Protection dashboard provides a summary of your endpoint activity in your environment. Use this dashboard to gain insights into your endpoint activity, learn about attack patterns, and analyze the effectiveness of your current threat and incident management process.  This dashboard includes visuals of the following data:

* Endpoint statuses
* Active platforms
* Malware attacks detected
* Most attacked users and endpoints
* Top attack types
* Blocked attacks
* Responses to attacks

The Endpoint Protection is a new dashboard that is part of the Dashboard feature. For more information about Dashboards, see [Dashboards](../dashboards.md).

The Endpoint Protection dashboard feeds from data in your Extended Endpoint Protection product. You must have an endpoint agent installed to a workstation or server to get value from this dashboard. To learn more about configuring Extended Endpoint Protection, see [Get Started with Alert Logic Extended Endpoint Protection](../../get-started/endpoint-protection.md).
