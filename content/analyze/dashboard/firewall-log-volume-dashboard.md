# Firewall Log Volume Analysis Dashboard

The Firewall Log Volume Analysis dashboard provides insights into the volume of firewall log messages, firewall security incidents and observations in your environment. Use this dashboard to quickly identify  patterns, trends and anomalies that require immediate response or further investigations. This dashboard includes visuals of the following data:

* Change amount and percentage of firewall log messages, observations and incidents
* Trends for firewall log messages, observations, and incidents

Alert Logic identifies relevant security information derived from one or multiple sources from the log data collected, which are referred to as observations. For more information about observations, see [Firewall observations](../firewall-incidents.md#Firewall-observations).

The Firewall Log Volume Analysis Dashboard is only offered to Managed Detection and Response Professional customers. You must have your firewall applications and log collection instances configured to see data in this dashboard. To learn more about firewall incidents, see [Firewall Incidents and Log Configuration](../firewall-incidents.md).
