The Endpoint Protection dashboard provides a summary of your endpoint activity in your environment. Use this dashboard to gain insights into your endpoint activity, learn about attack patterns, and analyze the effectiveness of your current threat and incident management process.  This dashboard includes visuals of the following data:

* Current count of endpoints that are on, off, or showing up with an error.
* Current count of endpoints that are up-to-date or out-of-date.
* Last time endpoints checked in.
* Current count of active platforms where endpoints are being hosted.
* Current count of malware attacks detected.
* Lists of users with the highest event count and percentage of attacks
* List of most attacked endpoints with the highest event count, and percentage of total attacks.
* List of malware attack types with the highest event count, and the percentage of total attacks.
* Current count of blocked malware attacks.
* Responses to attacks that were unresolved and quarantined.

The Endpoint Protection dashboard feeds from data in your Extended Endpoint Protection product. You must have an endpoint agent installed to a workstation or server to get value from this dashboard.
