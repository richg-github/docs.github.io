# About Analytics in the Threat Intelligence Center

The Threat Intelligence Center provides a tabular list for the properties of each analytic available from Alert Logic. Use the analytics view in the Threat Intelligence Center to validate Alert Logic threat coverage, learn about analytics content, investigate content configuration requirements, and source information for automated response. To learn more about the Threat Intelligence Center, see [Threat Intelligence Center (Beta)](../threat-intelligence-center.md).

## Learn about analytics

An Alert Logic analytic is a rule-based or machine learning algorithm that  uses telemetry data to evaluate activity to produce incidents or observations. An Alert Logic analytic refers to content  that uses telemetry data to evaluate activity to produce incidents or observations. An analytic can help process one or more specific threats, and threats can require one or more analytics to process. The Threat Intelligence Center provides a tabular list for the properties of each analytic. For more information about property definitions, use cases, and examples, see [Analytic properties details and use cases](#AnalyticPropertiesDetails).

    The Threat Intelligence Center displays all  security content and coverage details provided by Alert Logic. Customer-defined analytics, known as correlations, are not visible in the Threat Intelligence Center. For more information on defining your own rules for incidents and observations, see [Improved Correlations and Search](../search/search-correlation.md).    ## Validate threat coverage

Use the  analytics view to validate that Alert Logic covers specific threats. For more information about how to control filters and view specific threats, see [Customize the view in the Threat Intelligence Center](../threat-intelligence-center.md#Customiz).

##  Investigate content configuration requirements

You can  use the Threat Intelligence Center to verify that you configured the telemetry sources required to detect specific threats in your environment.

For example, you  find an analytic that uses log telemetry to evaluate threat activity. This source indicates that collection needs to be configured for the Log Source property of the analytic on your assets. Then Alert Logic can detect the threat. For more information on configuring specific log sources, see [Log Sources](../../deploy/log-sources.md) and [Application Registry](../../configure/application-registry.md). For a more detailed look at the log messages used by an analytic for a log source, including whether you have actually collected a specific log message type in your environment, see the use case for [Log Message Type ](about-log-parser-content.md#LogMessageType)## Source information for Automated Response

You can use the Threat Intelligence Center to   source information for [Automated Response (Beta)](../../respond/automated-response-new.md). Use the details provided in the [Possible Response Actions](#possible-response-actions) property of an analytic to verify which response actions can be configured for an incident or observation, when the analytic produces one. Use the details in the [Response Action Parameters ](#response-action-parameters) property to determine which incident or observation objects require response action on.

For example, an analytic may have a possible response action of "Block" and a response action parameter of "attacker." In automated response, you can design a playbook for when the analytic generates an incident. For this incident, a possible [Playbook task](../../respond/automated-response-new.md#Playbooktasks) would be to block the attacker IP.
Use the other content properties to determine analytic incident properties to use as triggers for automated response.  For more information on creating triggers for automated response, see [automated response-create a playbook].
