# Threat Classifications

The following table lists and defines the possible classification types.

| Classification label in Alert Logic console | Classification | Description  |
|---|---|---|
| application-attack | Application attack | An application attack incident identifies attacks that target application-specific vulnerabilities. Alert Logic creates an application attack incident when an attacker attempts to compromise an application with a buffer overflow, race condition, directory traversal, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, or <kbd>/usr/bin/perl</kbd> or other UNIX command attempts. |
| admin:activity | Admin activity | An authentication security incident identified from security applications is related specifically to administrative actions. Alert Logic generates an authentication security incident when a user  grants another user administrator privileges and a user attempts to access an admin application. |
| authentication:activity | Authentication activity | An authentication security incident identified from security applications  relates specifically to user logins and user behavior. Alert Logic generates an authentication security incident when brute force activity is detected from an IP address, disabled MFA of a user from the sign-in logs, login failure from a risky IP address and sign-in attempts from a malicious IP address, logins detected from multiple countries in one day, credential stuffing activity, and successful login from a risky IP. |
| brute-force | Brute force | A brute force incident identifies repeated authentication attempts and related activities. Alert Logic triggers a brute force incident when sufficient events indicate attempts to systematically compromise a system by brute force guessing valid user name and password combinations. |
| denial-of-service | Denial-of-service | A denial-of-service incident, which includes denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, identifies an attempt to make computer resources or services unavailable either temporarily or indefinitely. Attackers typically use DoS and DDoS either to prevent e-commerce retailers from conducting business, or to send a social message. Alert Logic creates a denial-of-service incident when events indicate this type of attack. |
|  | Info leak | An information leak incident is a generally successful recon attempt. Alert Logic creates an information leak incident when events indicate attempts at reconnaissance activities. For example, port scans used to identify open and closed ports or obtaining information from a secure system can trigger an incident. For more information about reconnaissance activities, see [Recon](#Recon). |
|  | Log policy | A log policy incident is triggered when Alert Logic creates a log policy incident automatically, based on selected correlated log messages and specific conditions you define.                        

For example, you can specify that Alert Logic identify log messages containing five failed login events within a 60-second time period, and then create a log policy incident. |
| log-review | Log Review | Log Review incidents come from the Alert LogicLog Review service. Some incidents are escalated by an Alert Logic analyst, and the rest appear as info level incidents. |
|  | Misconfiguration | Alert Logic triggers a misconfiguration incident when events indicate that a system is incorrectly configured. Attackers can use the misconfiguration to compromise the system. |
| policy-violation | Policy violation | A policy violation incident identifies activities that violate the acceptable use policies of most companies. These activities include viewing inappropriate material, peer-to-peer activity, and firewall policy changes. |
| recon | Recon | A recon incident identifies events that indicate reconnaissance activities against a network or set of hosts to evaluate them as a target. The activities that trigger this incident include gathering information about a server operating system, software versions, or the presence of debugging or demonstration scripts. |
| suspicious-activity | Suspicious activity | A suspicious activity incident identifies activity not included in another category that requires further research. Alert Logic creates a suspicious activity incident when anomalous activities, which could indicate a compromise, occur.

For example, the addition of a new domain administrator without the intent and knowledge of existing administrators could indicate an attacker added the administrator role to gain control over the environment or to provide a backdoor entry into the systems. |
| base | ?? |  |
| trojan-activity | Trojan activity | A Trojan activity incident identifies activity that indicates a host is infected by a Trojan horse or other type of backdoor malware, which masquerades as a legitimate program but actually steals information or harms the system. |
| worm-activity | Worm activity | A worm activity incident identifies hosts that display signs of worm infection.  A computer worm is self-replicating malware that uses a network to propagate and copy itself to other nodes, with or without your intervention. A worm typically uses a known vulnerability, and can cause damage by altering the infected system and consuming valuable network bandwidth. |
