# TRI Trends Report

The TRI Trends report provides insights into threat risk index (TRI) scores and trends in reducing risks, including average TRI scores, total vulnerability and host counts, internet-facing vulnerabilities, exploit availability, and last scanned age.

Use this report to identify patterns in the overall TRI score trends and contributing factors, gauge progress made, and focus efforts on key areas to reduce threats in your environment.

To access the TRI Summary report:

1. In the Alert Logic console, click the menu icon (![](../../../Resources/Images/dashboard/menu-icon.png)), and then click ![](../../../Resources/Images/dashboard/validate-icon.png)**Validate**.
2. Click **Reports**, and then click   **Risk**.
3. Under **Threat Risk Index**, click **VIEW**.
4. Click **TRI Trends**.
