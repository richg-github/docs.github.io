By default, the list is sorted by scan results last updated and organized in descending order. You can set the list to sort by any of the following items:

* Scan Results Last Updated
* Customer Account
* Deployment Name
* VPC/Network
* Asset Type
* IP Address
* Host Name
* Scan Schedule Name

You can also use the drop-down list to organize the list by **Ascending** or **Descending** order.

## Last Scanned Breakdown Details section

The list provides the breakdown of your last scanned assets for vulnerabilities based on  the selected filters. The list is organized by customer account, deployment name, VPC/network, asset type, IP address, host name, scan schedule name, last scan start time, last scan end time, scan duration, scan results last updated, and the number of days since scan results were last updated.
