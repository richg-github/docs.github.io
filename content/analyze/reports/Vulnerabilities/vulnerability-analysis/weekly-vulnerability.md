# Weekly Vulnerability Analysis

The Weekly Vulnerability Analysis report  provides insights into vulnerabilities and vulnerable assets found in your environment, including vulnerabilities by severity and age, vulnerability trends, vulnerabilities by day and severity, and top vulnerable hosts, networks, and deployment lists for the selected week. Use this report to gain insights into the effectiveness of your vulnerability management, help prioritize your efforts, and focus on specific areas in your environment.

This report presents data for an entire week, from Monday through Sunday, which immediately becomes available in the beginning of the following week.

## CVSS severity categories

Alert Logic uses CVSS v2 scores to measure the severity of vulnerabilities, which are divided into categories, and referenced to in some sections of this report.

Alert Logic assigns each vulnerability one of the following severities with corresponding icon based on the CVSS v2 score set by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and reported to the National Vulnerability Database:

| Severity | CVSS base score |
|---|---|
| ![](../../../../Resources/Images/Icons/threat_critical_icon.png) High | 7.0 - 10.0 |
| ![](../../../../Resources/Images/Icons/threat_high_icon.png)Medium | 4.0 - 6.9 |
| ![](../../../../Resources/Images/Icons/threat_medium_icon.png)Low | 0.1 - 3.9 |
| ![](../../../../Resources/Images/Icons/threat_info_icon.png)Informational | 0.0 |
