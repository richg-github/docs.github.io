# Monthly Vulnerable Hosts Explorer

The Monthly Vulnerability Hosts Explorer report provides a summary of the most vulnerable assets in your environment.  The report provides the following:

* Total hosts count and vulnerable hosts count
* Percentages of hosts with vulnerabilities
* Host distributions by CVSS severity ratings
* The top 10 view of your most vulnerable hosts

Alert Logic assigns each vulnerability one of the following severities with corresponding icon based on the CVSS v2 score set by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and reported to the National Vulnerability Database:

| Severity | CVSS base score |
|---|---|
| ![](../../../../Resources/Images/Icons/threat_critical_icon.png) High | 7.0 - 10.0 |
| ![](../../../../Resources/Images/Icons/threat_high_icon.png)Medium | 4.0 - 6.9 |
| ![](../../../../Resources/Images/Icons/threat_medium_icon.png)Low | 0.1 - 3.9 |
| ![](../../../../Resources/Images/Icons/threat_info_icon.png)Informational | 0.0 |

Use this report to determine where to focus resources and remediation efforts, or identify administrators that require additional guidance.
