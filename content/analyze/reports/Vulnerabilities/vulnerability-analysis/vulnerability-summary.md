# Monthly Vulnerability Summary

The Monthly Vulnerability Summary report provides summary headline, distribution, and trending data for vulnerabilities found across your environment. The report provides the following:

* Vulnerability status and vulnerable hosts counts
* Severity and age distribution
* Categorized trends
* Top 10 lists
* Exportable vulnerability list

Use this report to gain insights into the effectiveness of your current vulnerability management, learn about new vulnerabilities and emerging threats, help prioritize your efforts, and focus on specific areas in your environment.

Alert Logic assigns each vulnerability one of the following severities with corresponding icon based on the CVSS v2 score set by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and reported to the National Vulnerability Database:

| Severity | CVSS base score |
|---|---|
| ![](../../../../Resources/Images/Icons/threat_critical_icon.png) High | 7.0 - 10.0 |
| ![](../../../../Resources/Images/Icons/threat_high_icon.png)Medium | 4.0 - 6.9 |
| ![](../../../../Resources/Images/Icons/threat_medium_icon.png)Low | 0.1 - 3.9 |
| ![](../../../../Resources/Images/Icons/threat_info_icon.png)Informational | 0.0 |

## Vulnerabilities by Age and Severity section

This section presents the distribution of age and severity categories of vulnerabilities in the selected filters presented in color-coded circles. The age categories are the following:

* Over 90 days
* 46-90 days
* 31-45 days
* 0-30 days

Alert Logic assigns each vulnerability one of the following severities with corresponding icon based on the CVSS v2 score set by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and reported to the National Vulnerability Database:

| Severity | CVSS base score |
|---|---|
| ![](../../../../Resources/Images/Icons/threat_critical_icon.png) High | 7.0 - 10.0 |
| ![](../../../../Resources/Images/Icons/threat_high_icon.png)Medium | 4.0 - 6.9 |
| ![](../../../../Resources/Images/Icons/threat_medium_icon.png)Low | 0.1 - 3.9 |
| ![](../../../../Resources/Images/Icons/threat_info_icon.png)Informational | 0.0 |

The size of the circles represent the total vulnerabilities in each age category while its color represent the severity category of those vulnerabilities.

To see a specific list of vulnerabilities, click on a circle, severity category, age category, or number, and then click **List these vulnerabilities**. You also have the option to set additional filters on the **Vulnerability Summary** page when you click one or more circles in this section.

##  Vulnerability CVSSÂ Severity and Trends section

This section provides the distribution of CVSS severity categories and trend of vulnerabilities over the selected months in the selected filters.

Alert Logic assigns each vulnerability one of the following severities with corresponding icon based on the CVSS v2 score set by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and reported to the National Vulnerability Database:

| Severity | CVSS base score |
|---|---|
| ![](../../../../Resources/Images/Icons/threat_critical_icon.png) High | 7.0 - 10.0 |
| ![](../../../../Resources/Images/Icons/threat_high_icon.png)Medium | 4.0 - 6.9 |
