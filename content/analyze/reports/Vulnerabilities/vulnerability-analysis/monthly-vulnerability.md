# Monthly Vulnerability Analysis 

The Monthly Vulnerability Analysis report  provides insights into vulnerabilities and vulnerable assets found in your environment, including vulnerabilities by severity and age, vulnerability trends, vulnerabilities by day and severity, and top vulnerable hosts, networks, and deployment lists for the selected month. Use this report to gain insights into the effectiveness of your vulnerability management, help prioritize your efforts, and focus on specific areas in your environment.

This report presents data for an entire month, which immediately becomes available in the beginning of the following month.

To access the Monthly Vulnerability Analysis report:

1. In the Alert Logic console, click the menu icon (![](../../../../Resources/Images/dashboard/menu-icon.png)), and then click ![](../../../../Resources/Images/dashboard/validate-icon.png)**Validate**.
2. Click **Reports**, and then click **Vulnerabilities**.
3. Under **Vulnerability Analysis - Full Report**, click **VIEW**.
4. Click **Monthly Vulnerability Analysis**.

## Filter the report

To refine your findings, filter your report by  **Select Month**, **Customer Account**, **Deployment Name**, **Category**, **Severity**, **CVSS Score** and **Asset Type**.

### Filter the report using drop-down menus

By default, Alert Logic includes **(All)** filter values in the report.

**To add or remove filter values: **

1. Click the drop-down menu in the filter, and then select or clear values.

## CVSS severity categories

Alert Logic uses CVSS v2 scores to measure the severity of vulnerabilities, which are divided into categories, and referenced to in some sections of this report.

Alert Logic assigns each vulnerability one of the following severities with corresponding icon based on the CVSS v2 score set by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and reported to the National Vulnerability Database:

| Severity | CVSS base score |
|---|---|
| ![](../../../../Resources/Images/Icons/threat_critical_icon.png) High | 7.0 - 10.0 |
| ![](../../../../Resources/Images/Icons/threat_high_icon.png)Medium | 4.0 - 6.9 |
| ![](../../../../Resources/Images/Icons/threat_medium_icon.png)Low | 0.1 - 3.9 |
| ![](../../../../Resources/Images/Icons/threat_info_icon.png)Informational | 0.0 |
