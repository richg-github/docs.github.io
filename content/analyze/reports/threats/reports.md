# Threats Reports 

The **REPORTS** tab in the Alert Logic console provides access to data related to exposures and incidents Alert Logic found within your deployments. You can also view data related to your product usage within your accounts. For information on all the available report groups, see [Reports Guide](../reports.md).

The Threats reports provide convenient access to analysis, statistics, assessments, and trending data related to threats and incidents detected from your subscribed products and services. Alert Logic provides Threats reports within the following categories:

* [Incident Analysis](#incidentAnalysis) — Provides valuable insights and trending data for incidents created from all subscribed detection sources (Network IDS, Log Management, Amazon GuardDuty).
* [AWS Incident Analysis ](#AWSincident)— Provide valuable insights and trending data for incidents discovered in your AWS environments from Network IDS and incidents generated by Amazon GuardDuty security findings.
* [Azure Incident Analysis ](#Azureincident)— Provides valuable insights and trending data for incidents in your Azure environments created from Network IDS detection sources.
* [Incident Account Summary](#account) — Provide the current distribution and trending data for incidents detected across your customer accounts.
* [Log Review Analysis](#Log)— Provide valuable insights and trending data for incidents that are reviewed daily by Alert Logic security analysts.
* [ Web Application Analysis](#Web) — Provide valuable summary, distribution, and trending data for policy violations from your Alert Logic Managed Web Application Firewall (WAF).
* [Event Analysis](#Event) — Provides valuable insights and trending data for security events that were detected and processed in your environment from Network IDS sources.

To access the Threats reports, in the Alert Logic console,  click the menu icon (![](../../../Resources/Images/dashboard/menu-icon.png)), and then click ![](../../../Resources/Images/dashboard/validate-icon.png)**Validate**. Click **Reports**, and then click **Threats**.

Each report allows you to share its data by email, or download the report as an image, data, crosstab, PDF, or PowerPoint files. To learn how to download reports, see [Report Download Option](../download-option.md).

You can also schedule a report to run periodically and subscribe users or an integration (such as a webhook) to receive a notification when the report is generated.   From the Downloads tab on the Reports page, you can download and manage reports generated from your schedules. For more information, see [Scheduled Reports and Notifications](../../../configure/notifications/report.md).

## Filtering reports

You can filter your reports quickly to refine your results and generate relevant information you need. Each report has a set of filters located at the top that you can select or clear for the filters you want to see. Alert Logic also allows you to add or remove some or all values in a filter you want to see. Some reports also support filtering by visuals.

### Filter the report using drop-down menus

By default, Alert Logic includes **(All)** filter values in the report.

**To add or remove filter values: **

1. Click the drop-down menu in the filter, and then select or clear values.
