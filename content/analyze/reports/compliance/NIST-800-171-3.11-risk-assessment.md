# NIST 800-171 3.11 - Risk Assessment

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-171 Audit reports provide documentation and compliance artifacts that help you demonstrate compliance with the requirements outlined by NIST 800-171.

The NIST 800-171 3.11 - Risk Assessment report provides links to vulnerability scanning and vulnerability variance reporting features in the Alert Logic console that help demonstrate compliance with NIST 800-171 Derived Security Requirements 3.11.2 and 3.11.3.

**To access the NIST 800-171 3.11 - Risk Assessment report:**

1. In the Alert Logic console, click the menu icon (![](../../../Resources/Images/dashboard/menu-icon.png)), and then click ![](../../../Resources/Images/dashboard/validate-icon.png)**Validate**.

The report summary page displays two columns. **Derived Security Requirements** list specific requirements from the NIST 800-171 family for protecting Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) in nonfederal systems and organizations. **Available Documentation and Artifacts** describes and contains links to the documentation and compliance artifacts that this report can generate to meet each requirement.

## Derived Requirement 3.11.2

Derived Security Requirement 3.11.2  requires organizations to scan for vulnerabilities in organizational systems and applications periodically and when new vulnerabilities affecting those systems and applications are identified.

This section provides  a link to the Alert Logic Deployments page, where  can access vulnerability scan schedules. Select a deployment, and then click **Scan Schedules** to review the vulnerability scan schedules. For more information, see [Manage Scan Schedules](../../manage-scans-and-results/schedules.md).

## Derived Requirement 3.11.3

Derived Security Requirement 3.11.3 requires organizations to remediate vulnerabilities in accordance with risk assessments.

This section provides links to the following pages for quick access to  features in the Alert Logic console that help demonstrate compliance with the requirement:

* **PCI Scanning page**—From this page, you can access the PCI scanning feature  to review the latest 25 external vulnerability scan reports for the most recent 12-month period. For more information, see [Get Started with Alert Logic PCI Scans](../../../get-started/pci-scans.md).
* **Vulnerability Variance page**—From this page, you can access vulnerability variance reports to review summary, trending, and detailed lists for new, resolved, and unresolved vulnerabilities in your environment. For more information, see [Vulnerability Variance Reports](../Vulnerabilities/reports.md#Vulnerab2).
