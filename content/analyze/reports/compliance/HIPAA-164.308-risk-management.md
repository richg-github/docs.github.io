# HIPAA 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(B)â€”Risk Management

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Security Audit reports show available documentation and compliance artifacts that help you demonstrate compliance with requirements of the HIPAA Security Rule, as outlined in the HIPAA Audit Protocol.

This report provides information on security measures that reduce risk and vulnerabilities to a reasonable and appropriate level to help you demonstrate compliance with HIPAA 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(B).

## Available documentation and artifacts

This report provides documentation and artifacts that help you demonstrate that you have security measures implemented. These measures are sufficient to reduce risks and vulnerabilities to a reasonable and appropriate level to comply with HIPAA 164.306(a).

This report includes links for quick access to pages in the Alert Logic console, where you can access threat responses, vulnerability assessment findings, and threat risk index findings.

### Policy and procedures related to risk management

This HIPAA Audit Protocol requires a review of the policies and procedures related to risk management to evaluate and determine if the documents identify the risk management process, define what are considered acceptable levels of risks, state frequency of reviews for ongoing risks, and identify roles.

Alert Logic does not provide data for this testing procedure. You must provide the policy and procedure documents for this audit.

### Security measures implemented

This HIPAA Audit Protocol requires a review of the documentation that demonstrate the security measure implemented, or in the process of being implemented, as a result of the risk analysis or assessment. You must evaluate and determine whether the implemented security measures appropriately respond to threats and vulnerabilities identified in the risk analysis, according to the risk rating, and that the security measures are sufficient to mitigate or remediate identified risks to an acceptable level.

This section provides you with the following links for quick access to appropriate pages in the Alert Logic console:

* Threat responses in the [Incidents](../../incidents.md) page to review security incidents detected in your environment, and the actions taken in response.
* Vulnerability assessment findings in the [Vulnerabilities group of the Reports page](../reports.md#Vulnerability-reports) to review summary, distribution, and trending data for vulnerabilities identified in your environment.
* Threat risk index findings in the [Risk group of the Reports page](../reports.md#Risk-reports) to review summary and trending data for the threat risk index scores for the deployments and networks in your environment.
