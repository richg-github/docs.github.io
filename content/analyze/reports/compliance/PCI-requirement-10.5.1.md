## Log Management Users 

This report provides the list of Alert Logic console users and assigned roles that have access to the centralized audit trail files. You can use the list to verify that only appropriate personnel can access to the centralized audit trail files, and demonstrate that audit trails are limited to those with a job-related need. The list is organized by account name, user email, user name, and role name.
