# PCI Requirement 10.5.5

The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) Audit reports provide available documentation and compliance artifacts that help you demonstrate compliance with requirements of the PCI DSS.

The PCI Requirement 10.5.5 report provides guidance for how to access File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) features that help you demonstrate compliance with Requirement 10.5.5.

**To access the PCI Requirement 10.5.5 report:**

1. In the Alert Logic console, click the menu icon (![](../../../Resources/Images/dashboard/menu-icon.png)), and then click ![](../../../Resources/Images/dashboard/validate-icon.png)**Validate**.
2. Click **Reports**, and then click  **Compliance**.
3. Under **PCI DSS Audit**, click **VIEW**.
4. Click **PCI Requirement 10.5.5**.

The report summary page displays two columns. **Testing Procedures** lists each procedure that is required  for testing the selected PCI requirement. **Available Documentation and Artifacts** describes, and contains links to, the documentation and compliance artifacts that this report can demonstrate compliance with each testing procedure.

## Available Documentation and Artifacts

This report provides you with quick access to the FIM configuration and events that help you demonstrate that your organization uses a file-monitoring or change-detection software on logs to ensure that existing log data cannot be changed without generating alerts (although new data being added should not cause an alert).

### Testing procedure for PCI 10.5.5

This testing procedure requires you to prove that your organization examines systems settings, monitored files, and results from monitoring activities to verify the use of file-integrity monitoring or change-detection software on logs.

This section  provides you with a link for quick access to the [Get Started with Alert Logic Deployments](../../../get-started/deployments.md) page in the Alert Logic console where you can view the FIM section for configured monitoring file paths in a specific deployment.  You can use this information  to  demonstrate that processes are in place to verify the use of file-integrity monitoring or change-detection software on logs.

This section  also provides you with a link for quick access to the [File Integrity Monitoring Dashboard ](../../dashboard/file-integrity-monitoring.md) in the Alert Logic console, where you can view or export changes to your monitored software and configuration files.  You can use this information  to  demonstrate that processes are in place to verify the use of file-integrity monitoring or change-detection software on logs.
