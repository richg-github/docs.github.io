# NIST 800-171 3.14 - System and Information Integrity

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-171 Audit reports provide documentation and compliance artifacts that help you demonstrate compliance with the requirements outlined by NIST 800-171.

The NIST 800-171 3.14 - System and Information Integrity report provides links to endpoint protection, web application protection, and log search features in the Alert Logic console that help demonstrate compliance with the following NIST 800-171  requirements:

* Basic Security Requirements 3.14.1 and 3.14.2
* Derived Security Requirements 3.14.4 through 3.14.7

**To access the NIST 800-171 3.14 - System and Information Integrity report:**

1. In the Alert Logic console, click the menu icon (![](../../../Resources/Images/dashboard/menu-icon.png)), and then click ![](../../../Resources/Images/dashboard/validate-icon.png)**Validate**.
2. Click **Reports**, and then click  **Compliance**.

## Filter the Report

To refine your findings, you can filter your report by  date range and customer account.

### Filter the report using drop-down menus

By default, Alert Logic includes **(All)** filter values in the report.

This section provides a link to the  Endpoints tab of the Extended Endpoint Protection page, where you can access endpoint protection configuration. For more information, see [Manage Endpoints](../../../configure/extended-endpoint-protection/manage-endpoints.md).

This section also provides a link to the Events tab of the Extended Endpoint Protection page, which provides access to endpoint protection events to review malware attacks in your environment and the actions taken in response to quarantine and override malicious files or isolate vulnerable endpoints. For more information, see [Investigate an Extended Endpoint Protection Event](../../extended-endpoint-protection/investigate-event.md).

## Derived Security Requirement 3.14.4

Derived Security Requirement 3.14.4 requires organizations to update malicious code protection mechanisms when new releases are available.

This section provides a link to the Summary tab of the Extended Endpoint Protection page, where you can view the configuration summary for endpoints running the most updated version. For more information about the Extended Endpoint Protection page, see [About Alert Logic Extended Endpoint Protection](../../../get-started/about-extended-endpoint-protection.md).

## Derived Security Requirement 3.14.5

Derived Security Requirement 3.14.5 requires organizations to perform periodic scans of organizational systems and real-time scans of files from external sources as files are downloaded, opened, or executed.

This section provides a link to the Endpoints tab of the Extended Endpoint Protection page, where you can access to the endpoint protection configuration. For more information, see [Manage Endpoints](../../../configure/extended-endpoint-protection/manage-endpoints.md).

This section also provides a link to the Events tab of the Extended Endpoint Protection page, which provides access to endpoint protection events to review malware attacks in your environment and the actions taken in response to quarantine and override malicious files or isolate vulnerable endpoints.
