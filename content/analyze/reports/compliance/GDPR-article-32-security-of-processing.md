* The [Health](../../health.md) console, where you can check the status of your networks monitored by the Network IDS  to identify potential threat activity including data exfiltration, brute force, privilege escalations, and command and control exploits.
* The [Health](../../health.md) console, where you can check the status of your agent configuration for log management collection, which supports analysis for indicators of compromise, suspicious behaviors, and support incident response forensics.
* The Alert Logic Managed Web Application Firewall (WAF) configuration page, where you can [Configure Alert Logic Managed Web Application Firewall (WAF)](../../../configure/inline-waf/configure.md) to block dozens of web application attack classifications.
* The Deployments page, where you can configure [File Integrity Monitoring ](../../../configure/file-integrity-monitoring.md) to change how you monitor specific file paths.
* The Extended Endpoint Protection configuration page, where you can [Manage Endpoints](../../../configure/extended-endpoint-protection/manage-endpoints.md) and review the protection status, anti-malware software version status, and last check-in time for Windows and macOS endpoints in your environment.
