### Requirement 1

Requirement 1 of GDPR Article 34 requires the controller to notify a personal data breach to the data subject without undue delay.

This section provides you with the following links for quick access to appropriate pages in the Alert Logic console:

* The Alert Logic Escalated Contact report, which lists designated alerted users  and escalation contacts when critical incidents are detected in your environment. You can use the Escalated Contact report to review the contacts who are notified in your organization and determine if they are the appropriate supervisory authority competent to handle a personal data breach.
* The Alert Logic[Subscribed Notification Users](../service/users/subscribed-notification-users.md) report, which lists  users subscribed to receive notifications for specified customer accounts. You can use  the [Subscribed Notification Users](../service/users/subscribed-notification-users.md) report to review the contacts who are notified in your organization and determine if they are the appropriate supervisory authority to handle a personal data breach.

### Requirement 2

Requirement 2 of  GDPR Article 34 requires that the communication to the data subject referred to in requirement 1 be in clear and plain language, and that it describe the nature of the personal data breach and contain at least the information and measured referred to in points (b), (c), and (d) of Article 33, [Requirement 3 ](GDPR-article-33-notification-personal-data-breach.md#article33-3).

Alert Logic does not provide data for this requirement.

### Requirement 3 

Requirement 3 of  GDPR Article 34 allows that requirement 1 is not required if any of the following conditions are met:

1. Protection measures were applied to the personal data affected by the breach that render the personal data unintelligible to any person who is not authorised to access it, such as encryption.
2. Subsequent measures were taken which ensure that the high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects are no longer likely.
3. It would involve disproportionate efforts. In such a case, there shall instead be a public communication or similar measure to inform data subjects in an equally effective manner.

Alert Logic does not provide data for this requirement.

### Requirement 4 

Requirement 4 of  GDPR Article 34 allows, if the controller has not already communicated the data breach to the data subject, a supervisory authority to require the controller to communicate the personal data breach to a data subject or decide that any of the conditions in requirement 3 are met.

Alert Logic does not provide data for this requirement.
