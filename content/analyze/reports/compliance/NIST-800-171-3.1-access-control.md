## Derived Security Requirement 3.1.7

Derived Security Requirement 3.1.7  requires systems to prevent non-privileged users from executing privileged functions and capture the execution of such functions in audit logs.

This section provides links  to access log searches in the Alert Logic console, where a prepopulated query will search logs for message types related to changing user accounts and groups, elevating user privileges or changing user accounts with root or administrative privileges. For more information about searching log messages, see [Search: Log Messages](../../log-message-search.md).

## Derived Security Requirements 3.1.8, 3.1.11, and 3.1.12

Derived Security Requirement 3.1.8 requires systems to limit unsuccessful logon attempts.

Derived Security Requirement 3.1.11 requires systems to terminate (automatically) a user session after a defined condition.

Derived Security Requirement 3.1.12 requires systems to monitor and control remote access sessions.

This section provides links to access the log searches in the Alert Logic console, where a prepopulated query will search logs for messages containing "Login failed", "Login Failure", or "Login Denied".
