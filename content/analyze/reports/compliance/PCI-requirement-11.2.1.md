The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) Audit reports provide available documentation and compliance artifacts that help you demonstrate compliance with requirements of the PCI DSS.

The PCI Requirement 11.2.1 report provides guidance to demonstrate that quarterly internal vulnerability scans, "high-risk" vulnerabilities are rescanned, and performed by qualified personnel, in compliance with Requirement 11.2.1.

## Available Documentation and Artifacts

This report provides you with documentation and artifacts  to help you demonstrate that quarterly internal vulnerability scans are performed, vulnerabilities are addressed, "high-risk" vulnerabilities are rescanned until resolved, and scans are performed by qualified personnel.

### Testing procedure for PCI 11.2.1.a

This testing procedure requires a review of the scan reports to verify that the four most recent quarters of internal scans occurred in the most recent 12 month period.

This section provides you with a link for quick access to the [PCI scanning page](../../../configure/pci-scans.md) in the Alert Logic console to review the latest 25 internal vulnerability scan reports for the most recent 12 month period.

### Testing procedure for PCI 11.2.1.b

This testing procedure requires a review of the scan reports to verify that all "high-risk" vulnerabilities are addressed, and have been rescanned to resolution.

This section provides you with a link for quick access to the [vulnerability reports in the Reports page](../reports.md#Vulnerability-reports) in the Alert Logic console to review vulnerability summary, distribution, and trends discovered and addressed across your environment.

### Testing procedure for PCI 11.2.1.c

This testing procedure requires you to verify that the scan was performed by a qualified internal resource or qualified external third party.

This section provides you with a link to the [Deployments](../../../get-started/deployments.md) page in the Alert Logic console for quick access to configure schedules of when Alert Logic performs scans.
