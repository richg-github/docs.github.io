## Available Documentation and Artifacts

This report provides documentation and artifacts that help you demonstrate that you have developed and implemented a Risk Management Program  sufficient to comply with Control Reference 03.b Perform Risk Assessments in Control Category 03.0.

This report includes links for quick access to pages in the Alert Logic console, where you can access vulnerability assessment findings, threat risk index findings, and threat responses.

## Control Reference 03.b  (Level 1 Implementation Requirements)

Control Reference 03.b Perform Risk Assessments requires that you perform risk assessments consistently and identify security risks to the organization. You must account for risks from sources including prior incidents experienced, changes in the environment (for example, new methods of attack, new sources of attack, and new vulnerabilities), and any supervisory guidance such as from third-party consultants.

Risk assessments may be quantitative, semi-quantitative, quasi-quantitative, or qualitative but must be consistent and comparable, so the resources to manage risk can be prioritized. You must perform risk assessments  at planned intervals, or when major changes occur in the environment, and review the results annually.

This report section provides you with the following links for quick access to appropriate pages in the Alert Logic console that illustrate compliance with procedures in Control Reference 03.b:

* Vulnerability assessment findings in the [Vulnerabilities group of the Reports page](../reports.md#Vulnerability-reports) to review summary, distribution, and trending data for vulnerabilities identified in your environment.
* Threat risk index findings in the [Risk group of the Reports page](../reports.md#Risk-reports) to review summary and trending data for the threat risk index scores for the deployments and networks in your environment.
* Threat responses in the [Incidents](../../incidents.md) page to review security incidents detected in your environment and the actions taken in response.
