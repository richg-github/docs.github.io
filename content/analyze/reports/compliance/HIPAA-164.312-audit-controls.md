This report provides documentation and artifacts that help you demonstrate that the software or procedural mechanism records and examines activity in information systems that contain or use electronic protected health information (ePHI).

### Record and examine activity in information systems

This HIPAA Audit Protocol requires you to demonstrate that you have a hardware, software and/or procedural mechanism to record and examine activity in information systems that contain or use ePHI.

This section includes a link for quick access to the HIPAA 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(D) report in the Reports page in the Alert Logic console to review audit control mechanisms that help you comply with the required implementation specification.
