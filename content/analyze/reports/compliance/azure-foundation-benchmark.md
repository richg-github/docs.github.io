# CIS Microsoft Azure Foundation Benchmark

CIS Microsoft Azure Foundation Benchmark report provides an assessment of how your environment conforms to configuration guidelines developed by Center for Internet Security (CIS) experts. Alert Logic performs a series of benchmark checks on your Azure deployments to display the statuses of the checks for each section.

For more information about Microsoft Azure CISÂ Benchmarks, see [cisecurity.org/benchmark/azure](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/azure/).

For customers who are configuring an Azure deployment for the first time, or customers who have Azure deployments but do not have an Azure app registration set up, see [Configure App Registration and RBAC for Microsoft Azure Resources](../../../prepare/azure-rbac-role-setup.md).

If you have existing Azure deployments, and already have an app registration set up, see [Update your Azure Deployment for CIS Foundation Benchmarks ](../../../prepare/azure-benchmark-deployment-configuration.md).
