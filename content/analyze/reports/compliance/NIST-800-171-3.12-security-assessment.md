# NIST 800-171 3.12 - Security Assessment

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-171 Audit reports provide documentation and compliance artifacts that help you demonstrate compliance with the requirements outlined by NIST 800-171.

The NIST 800-171 3.12 - Security Assessment report provides links to vulnerability assessment and threat risk index reporting features in the Alert Logic console that help demonstrate compliance with NIST 800-171 Derived Security Requirement 3.12.3.

**To access the NIST 800-171 3.12 - Security Assessment report:**

The report summary page displays two columns. **Derived Security Requirements** lists specific requirements from the NIST 800-171 family for protecting Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) in nonfederal systems and organizations. **Available Documentation and Artifacts** describes and contains links to the documentation and compliance artifacts that this report can generate to meet each requirement.

##  Derived Security Requirement 3.12.3

Derived Security Requirement 3.12.3  requires organizations to monitor security controls on an ongoing basis to ensure the continued effectiveness of the controls.

This section provides links to the following pages for quick access to appropriate features in the Alert Logic console that help demonstrate compliance with the requirement:

* **Vulnerability Analysis page**—From this page, you can access vulnerability analysis reports to review summary, distribution, and trending data for vulnerabilities identified in your environment. For more information, see [Vulnerability Analysis](../Vulnerabilities/reports.md#vulnerabilityAnalysis).
* **Threat Risk Index page**—From this page, you can access threat risk index (TRI) reports to review summary and trending data for the TRI scores for the deployments and networks in your environment. For more information about the reports, see [Threat Risk Index ](../risk/reports.md#Threat-Risk). For more information about TRI scores and how Alert Logic calculates them, see [Threat Risk Index Score Factors](../../TRI-score-factors.md).
* Vulnerability Variance page—From this page, you can access vulnerability variance reports to review summary, trending, and detailed lists for new, resolved, and unresolved vulnerabilities in your environment. For more information, see [Vulnerability Variance Reports](../Vulnerabilities/reports.md#Vulnerab2).
