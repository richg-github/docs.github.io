# Remediations Reports

The **REPORTS** page in the Alert Logic console provides access to data related to exposures and incidents Alert Logic found within your deployments. You can also view data related to your product usage within your accounts. For information on all the available report groups, see [Reports Guide](../reports.md).

The Remediations reports group provide convenient access to analysis, statistics, assessments, and trending data related to configuration issues and security exposures from your subscribed products and services. Alert Logic provides Remediations reports within the following categories:

* [Configuration Remediations](#Configur)—Provide valuable summary, distribution, and trending data for your responsiveness of known product configuration and health issues in your environment. You can gain insight into configuration management patterns that improve prioritization and maximize your collection, scanning, detection, or response capabilities.
* [Security Remediations](#Security)—Provide valuable summary, distribution, and trending data on your responsiveness of security exposures found in your environment. You can gain insight into security exposure management patterns that improve prioritization, and reduce the exposure of your assets to threats.

To access the Remediations reports, in the Alert Logic console,  click the menu icon (![](../../../Resources/Images/dashboard/menu-icon.png)), and then click ![](../../../Resources/Images/dashboard/validate-icon.png)**Validate**. Click **Reports**, and then click **Remediations**.

Each report allows you to share its data by email, or download the report as an image, data, crosstab, PDF, or PowerPoint files. To learn how to download reports, see [Report Download Option](../download-option.md).

You can also schedule a report to run periodically and subscribe users or an integration (such as a webhook) to receive a notification when the report is generated.
