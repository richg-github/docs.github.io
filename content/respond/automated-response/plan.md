# Plan Your Automated Response

An important first step in any Automated Response solution is to develop a plan.

Before you start creating your playbook, Alert Logic recommends completing these steps in preparation:

* Identify automation opportunities
* Define the problem
* Identify who will use the automation
* Define your automation goals
* Outline the process
* Design the architecture (create asset groups, configure connection targets and connectors)
