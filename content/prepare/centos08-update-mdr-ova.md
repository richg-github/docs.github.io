# CentOS Version 8 Update for MDR Customers using OVA 

CentOS announced the end of life for their version 6 operating system. This means CentOSÂ will no longer provide security patches, vulnerabilities, or bug fixes for version 6. As a result, Alert Logic is helping customers update all Alert Logic appliances running on operating system CentOS version 6 to the current and supported version 8.

As Alert Logic transitions all customers to CentOS 8, Alert Logic will continue maintain necessary security updates for CentOS version 6 to ensure all customers remain secure.

## How to update for MDR customers using OVA image

1. You must install a new appliance for every appliance you are currently running with the new OVA image. See [Install and Configure the Virtual Appliance.](virtual-appliance.md)
2. Check the health of your agents and appliances on the Health page in the Alert Logic console. See [Health](../analyze/health.md).
3. Terminate the old appliance.
