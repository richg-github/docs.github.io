# CentOS Version 8 Update for AWS Legacy Customers

CentOS announced the end of life for their version 6 operating system. This means CentOSÂ will no longer provide security patches, vulnerabilities, or bug fixes for version 6. As a result, Alert Logic is helping customers update all Alert Logic appliances running on operating system CentOS version 6 to the current and supported version 8.

As Alert Logic transitions all customers to CentOS 8, Alert Logic will continue maintain necessary security updates for CentOS version 6 to ensure all customers remain secure.

## How to update for legacy customers with AWS deployments

You must first install and claim the new appliance, ensure the assignment policy is in the new appliance, terminate the old appliance, and then remove the assignment policy from it. After you verify that the agent  is sending data to the new appliance, you must request Alert Logic to decommission the old appliance.

1. You must install a new appliance for every appliance you have in each VPC, along with the P15 appliance AMI. You can find the P15 AMI in the AWS console, under **My AMIs**, and then click **Shared with me**. If you do not see the P15 AMI, contact [Alert LogicTechnical Support](mailto:support@alertlogic.com)  and request that the AMI is shared to your AWS account. To claim a new appliance, refer to [Claim your appliance for Amazon Web Services Direct (Linux)](https://legacy.docs.alertlogic.com/install/cloud/amazon-web-services-threat-manager-direct-linux.htm#claimYourAppliance).
2. After the new appliance or appliances are claim spun up, verify that the VPC assignment policy has the new appliance(s) in it. If you do not see the VPC assignment policy, you must add the appliance(s) to the current assignment policy that is in use with the default assignment policy for the agent. To create an assignment policy, see the [Create an assignment policy](https://legacy.docs.alertlogic.com/install/cloud/amazon-web-services-threat-manager-direct-linux.htm#Createanassignmentpolicy) section.
3. After the old appliance is terminated, verify the agent is sending data to the new appliance. To verify in the Alert Logic console:
Statistics are updated every 15 minutes in the Alert Logic console.
   1. Click the **Configuration** tab.
   2. Click **All Deployments**.
   3. Click **Networks and Protected Hosts**, and then click the **Protected Hosts** tab.
   4. Click on the agent to see more details.
5. After the assignment policy has the new appliance, you can terminate the old appliance and remove it from the assignment policy. The agents will automatically shift over to the new appliance(s). To learn how to manage assignment policies, see the [Delete an assignment policy](https://legacy.docs.alertlogic.com/userGuides/threat-manager-policies.htm#Deleteanassignmentpolicy) section.
6. After you have confirmed the new appliance is running, the assignment policy has the new appliance and the old appliance is terminated, you can submit a ticket to [Alert LogicTechnical Support](mailto:support@alertlogic.com) with the  ID of the old appliance for them to decommission.
