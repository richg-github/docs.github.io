# Manage Your User Account

The Alert Logic Users page allows you to manage user account settings, such as your name, contact information, and password.

User accounts with the administrator role can manage the details for other users in their organization. For more information about creating and managing other accounts, see [Customer Accounts, User Accounts, and User Roles](users-roles.md).

## Update your user account details
