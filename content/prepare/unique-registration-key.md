# Access Unique Registration Keys for Data Center Deployments

Each network configured in your Data Center deployments has a Unique Registration Key. During the installation process for the Alert Logic agent, virtual appliance, and remote collectors, you must provide the key when prompted. The Unique Registration Key specifies where the agent, appliance, or collector is located.

To access your Unique Registration Key:

1. In the Alert Logic console, open the relevant Data Center deployment.
2. Under **Configuration Overview**, click **Installation Instructions**.
3. Copy your Unique Registration Key.
