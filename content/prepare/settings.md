# Settings Menu

The documentation below describes the previous version of the Alert Logic console, which was recently updated. The Settings Menu will be phased out in early 2020, but all functionality will remain. For information about new link locations, see [Get Started with the Alert Logic Console](../get-started/get-started-console.md).

Click the Settings icon (![](../Resources/Images/supportThreeDots.png)) to get to the Settings menu. The menu includes support information, integrations configuration, user settings, notifications, service status, vulnerability updates, PCI scanning, PCI scan disputes, and the link to sign out of the Alert Logic console. The following are the pages in the Settings menu:

* [Support Information](#supportInfo)

* [Connectors](#Connectors)
* [Users](#users)
* [Notifications](#Notifica)
* [Service Status](#Service)

## Support Information

The Support information page provides account details and information you need when you contact Technical Support. Click the **Details** subtopic for the following:

* Your customer ID
* Your unique user ID
* The email address associated with your account
* Links for training, knowledge base articles, and documentation

## Integrations

Alert Logic integrations allow you to extend Alert Logic into AWS Inspector, AWS Config Rules, configure Custom Checks as inputs to Alert Logic, and even integrate with the Atlassian Jira ticketing system.

## Connectors

The Connectors page allows you to configure webhook and email connectors that send alert notifications to any public-facing HTTP endpoint. Connectors is a convenient feature that  allows the Alert Logic Incident Console to send real-time data directly to a third-party application. For more information, see [Webhook and Email Connectors](../configure/connectors.md).

## Users

The Users page allows you to create and manage user accounts for members of your team. The Users page lists the users you created and allows you to create, edit, and remove users, as well as assign them roles with administrator, power user, or read-only privileges. Scroll through the directory of users, or click a letter on the left index to skip to that spot in the directory. For more information, see [Customer Accounts, User Accounts, and User Roles](users-roles.md#usersAndGroups).

## Notifications

The Notifications page allows you to configure and manage notifications  in the Alert Logic console. You can subscribe users and a connector such as a webhook to receive notifications about threats, changes, and scheduled events in your environment so you can respond quickly. You can configure notifications for your own account and accounts you manage. For more information about notifications, see [Notifications](../configure/notifications.md#usersAndGroups).

## Service Status

The Service Status page allows you to view information about statuses of all systems, services, and product capabilities from your subscription. You can view the status of a service or product capability, check for updates of incidents in progress, and subscribe to receive notifications when there are status changes. For more information, see [Service Status](../analyze/service-status.md).

## Vulnerability Library

The Vulnerability Library page  lists all of the scan content that Alert Logic scanners can check. You can easily search for and view information on a specified vulnerability, and see whether it impacts assets in your environment. For more information, see [Vulnerability Library](../analyze/vulnerability-library.md).

## PCI Scanning

The PCI Scanning page allows you to schedule  external scans that are required for PCI compliance. You can view the current status of your last scan and the latest 25 PCI scan reports, schedule a new scan, view PCI disputes, and view results of all your scans. For more information, see [Manage PCI Scans](../configure/pci-scans.md#Manage2).

## Legacy Scan Results

If you upgraded to Managed Detection and Response from Alert LogicÂ legacy products, the Legacy Scan Results page allows you to view your legacy scan results.  You can choose a customer in the drop-down menu to view legacy scan results for that customer. You can also access the legacy scan results from the Reports page. For more information, see [Manage Scans and Scan Results](../analyze/manage-scans-and-scan-results.md#View2).

## PCI Scan Disputes

PCI Scan Disputes lists the scan disputes you submitted, along with their details and statuses. For more information, see [Dispute failing vulnerabilities](../configure/pci-scans.md#Dispute).
