## Power indicator codes

An LED indicator on the power button indicates when power is supplied to the system and the system is operational. The power supplies have an indicator that shows whether power is present or whether a power fault has occurred.

* Not lit—AC power is not connected.
* Green—In standby mode, indicates that a valid AC source is connected to the power supply, and that the power supply is operational. When the system is on, it also indicates that the power supply is providing DC power to the system.
* Amber—Indicates a problem with the power supply.
* Alternating green and amber—When hot-adding a power supply, this indicates that the power supply is mismatched with the other power supply (a high output power supply and an Energy Smart power supply are installed in the same system). Replace the power supply that has the flashing indicator with a power supply that matches the capacity of the other installed power supply.

## Rails

Your Alert Logic appliance ships with ReadyRails™ in the box. ReadyRails™ sliding and static rail systems for the R410 provide tool-less support for 4-post racks with square or unthreaded round mounting holes, including all generations of Dell racks. Both support tooled mounting in 4-post threaded racks (an optional adapter brackets kit is required for the sliding rails). The static rails also provide tooled mounting support for 2-post (Telco) racks for added versatility. The optional cable management (CMA) arm can be mounted on either the left or right side of the sliding rails without the use of tools for fast and easy deployment.

**Note** The R410 is not compatible with any other Dell rails, including previous generation rails, but it does use the same sliding rails as the R310 and the same static rails as the R210 and R310.
