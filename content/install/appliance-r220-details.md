</table>## Power indicator codes

An LED indicator on the power button indicates when power is supplied to the system and the system is operational. The power supplies have an indicator that shows whether power is present or whether a power fault has occurred.

* Not lit—AC power is not connected.
* Green—In standby mode, indicates that a valid AC source is connected to the power supply, and that the power supply is operational. When the system is on, it also indicates that the power supply is providing DC power to the system.
* Amber—Indicates a problem with the power supply.
* Alternating green and amber—When hot-adding a power supply, this indicates that the power supply is mismatched with the other power supply (a high output power supply and an Energy Smart power supply are installed in the same system). Replace the power supply that has the flashing indicator with a power supply that matches the capacity of the other installed power supply.
