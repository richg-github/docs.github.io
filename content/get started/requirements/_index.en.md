### Pre-requisites

Before you start using the Alert Logic developer portal and APIs, make sure you have the following:

* An active Alert Logic customer account
* An active Alert Logic user account
* A password or access key

### Active Alert Logic customer account

Sign up for an account in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Marketplace if you do not already have an account.

Some APIs may not be available with the subscription you have. If your subscription is not Professional or higher, you cannot access Incidents. Access to certain features are noted in the docs. Talk to your Alert Logic representative if you want to upgrade. For more information about Alert Logicsubscriptions, see Get Started with Alert Logic Subscriptions and Add-ons.

### Active Alert Logic user account

If you have successfully logged into the Alert Logic console before, you have access. If you are not sure, contact your administrator.

### Password or access key

Alert Logic recommends that you use both an access key and a secret key. You can create these in the Alert Logic console. For more information about how to create an access key and secret key, see Create and Manage Alert Logic Access Keys.

### API Access

To access the Alert Logic APIs, you must have a connection to the Alert Logic API endpoints.

You do not need a connection with appliances or agents themselves.

### CLI Installation Requirements

The Alert Logic CLI supports the current version and the previous major version of Mac and Windows operating systems, and any modern Linux system with Python.

The Alert Logic CLI requires at least 50MB disk space.

Python Requirements

Mac and Linux users must have Python version 3.7 or higher.

Upgrade using a Python-native PIP tool.

The CLI installer for Windows includes its own version of Python.
