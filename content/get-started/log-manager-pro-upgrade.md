# Log Manager Pro Upgrade

Alert Logic Log Manager collects, aggregates, and normalizes log data whether it originates in your own data center, a hosted environment, or the cloud. Flexible data collection options, including physical appliances, remote collectors with agents or without agents, and cloud native APIs, provide low-impact deployment options for all of your infrastructure. Alert Logic will upgrade Log Management customers to Log Management Pro, which includes a number of changes to your experience.

The Alert Logic console shows only the tabs and pages appropriate to your product subscription. This topic describes all possible tabs and pages, but specifies the subscriptions that generate the tabs and pages.  For more information about subscriptions Alert Logic offers, see [Get Started with Alert Logic   Subscriptions and Add-ons](subscriptions-addons.md).

## Prerequisites

Prior to your upgrade, you must perform the following deployment and agent updates:

* If you have Amazon Web Services (AWS) deployments, you must ensure your deployments use IAM roles created with the most current policy documents. To update IAM roles, see [Update your IAMÂ roles](../prepare/aws-cross-account-role-setup.md#update-roles).
* If you have Azure deployments, you must ensure your Microsoft Azure resources are configured to allow Alert Logic to discover and monitor your assets. To ensure your Azure deployments are properly configured, see [Configure App Registration and RBAC for Microsoft Azure Resources](../prepare/azure-rbac-role-setup.md).
* Upgrade your agents and appliances to the most recent version. Download and install the appropriate agents or appliances. For more information, see the following documents:
   * [Install the Alert Logic Agent for Linux](../prepare/alert-logic-agent-linux.md)
   * [Install the Alert Logic Agent for Windows](../prepare/alert-logic-agent-windows.md)
   * [Install and Configure the  Virtual Appliance](../prepare/virtual-appliance.md)
