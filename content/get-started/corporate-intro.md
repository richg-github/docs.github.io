## About ActiveIntegration (REST) APIs

### How It Works

The ActiveIntegration APIs are based on the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style, using standard HTTP methods and status codes. These APIs are resource-based where each resource is associated with a URL that identifies a set of objects. An API endpoint is composed of the HTTP method and the URL associated with the resource. The API endpoints produce JSON schema formatted responses.

### For Organizations

<p>With ActiveIntegration APIs you can, for example, integrate <MadCap:variable name="SDKVariables.Company" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd" /> directly into your IT ticketing systems streamlining your response to incidents identified by the <MadCap:variable name="SDKVariables.Company" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd" /> ActiveWatch team. You could also incorporate <MadCap:variable name="SDKVariables.Company" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd" /> security and compliance solutions into your DevOps program, ensuring new assets are protected as they are deployed.</p>
