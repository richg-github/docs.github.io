# Get started with Alert Logic Cloud Defender on Google Cloud Platform

Alert Logic Cloud Defender is a comprehensive suite of security software, including Threat Manager, Log Manager, Web Security Manager, and Cloud Insight.

Alert Logic Cloud Insight is included with Cloud Defender for any Amazon Web Services (AWS) deployments. Cloud InsightÂ is available only for AWS deployments, so it uses  a separate portal. For more information about provisioning and usage of Cloud Insight, see [Get Started with Cloud Insight](get-started-cloud-defender.md).

Cloud Defender in the Google Cloud Platform is currently a managed install. To ensure you get the full value of Cloud Defender from the start, Alert Logic handles the complete installation process with you.

## Requirements

Before you deploy Cloud Defender, you should review the [Operating System and Browser Requirements ](../requirements/operating-system-browsers.md) and either the [United States Firewall Rules](../requirements/us-firewall-rules.md#usFirewallRules) or the [United Kingdom and European Union Firewall Rules](../requirements/uk-eu-firewall-rules.md#euFirewallRules) for Cloud Defender.
