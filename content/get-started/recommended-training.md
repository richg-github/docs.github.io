## Web Log Analytics (WLA)

Alert Logic Web Log Analytics (WLA) is a log-based application attack detection solution that protects your web applications from common application vulnerabilities. WLA analyzes web server access logs for threats and attacks with a combination of pattern-matching signatures, and anomaly detection and machine-learning engine. WLA also reduces the need for tuning, minimizes false-positives, and provides visibility by inspecting HTTPS requests for threats post-decryption. You can gain security visibility across all web applications in your organization.

WLA currently supports IIS, Apache2, and Nginx web servers.

## Extended Endpoint Protection

The Extended Endpoint Protection functionality from Alert Logic helps you control threats and manage incidents from employee workstations, points of sale, servers, and more.

Extended Endpoint Protection is built to provide value and scale immediately. You can silently install the agent on many endpoints in minutes using any tool that supports deploying EXE or MSI files, including system management tools or Windows Group Policy. Once you deploy Extended Endpoint Protection, the endpoints automatically register, and you can manage them in the Alert Logic console.

To access the Endpoints page, click the menu icon (![](../Resources/Images/dashboard/menu-icon.png)), click  ![](../Resources/Images/dashboard/configure-icon.png)**Configure**, and then click **Endpoints**.
