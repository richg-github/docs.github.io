# Upgrade to Managed Detection and Response

The Alert Logic console provides a universal navigation experience for all Alert Logic customers, regardless of your product subscriptions.

The Alert Logic console shows only the tabs and pages appropriate to your product subscription. This topic describes all possible tabs and pages, but specifies the subscriptions that generate the tabs and pages.  For more information about subscriptions Alert Logic offers, see [Get Started with Alert Logic   Subscriptions and Add-ons](subscriptions-addons.md).

## Upgrade process and window

Prior to your upgrade, Alert Logic performs a migration precheck  to uncover issues in your environment that can prevent a successful upgrade. An implementation engineer shares results and schedules a meeting with your engineering team to review  any required and recommended actions. For details about the precheck, see [Migration Prechecks](../reference/migration-prechecks.md).

After your team resolves any blocking issues, Alert Logic works with you to schedule the migration. Plan to allow 48 hours for the Alert Logic team to complete your upgrade. The two-day window allows time for troubleshooting, if necessary. The upgrade occurs during business hours Monday to Friday, with the actual migration taking approximately one hour.

## Prerequisites

Prior to your upgrade, you must perform the following cloud deployment updates:

* If you have Amazon Web Services (AWS) deployments to upgrade, you must ensure they use IAM roles created with the most current policy documents. To ensure your AWS deployments are configured properly, see:
   * [Update AWS IAM Roles to Prepare for Upgrade](update-aws-roles-for-upgrade.md#update-roles)
   * [AWS deployments with no credentials](../reference/migration-prechecks.md#AWSdeploymentswithnocredentials)
* If you have Azure deployments to upgrade, you must ensure that the configuration of the resources allows Alert Logic to discover and monitor your assets. To ensure your Azure deployments are configured properly, see [Update Azure Deployment Configuration to Prepare for Upgrade](update-azure-deployments-for-upgrade.md).

For a complete list of issues that can block your upgrade or affect its success, see [Migration Prechecks](../reference/migration-prechecks.md).
